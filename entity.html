This past weekend I did finally venture into Salvia Space for the first time. I took four droppers of Emerald Essence diluted with two-and-a-half droppers of water. I followed the instructions to the letter, and what followed was a true experience. It was undoubtedly a level-4 journey with some level-5 characteristics. I wrote this piece, though it is not much. It sort of chronologically describes the hour-long experience. I didn’t think a descriptive diatribe fit. The individual words/descriptions were taken down all through the following day in reflection.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<tr>
	<td>Too many meanings for one word:<P>

Wow – how?!<BR>
Suddenlous – feminine, facial silhouette by the nightlight<BR>
Loving – embraces, for I have taken the step<BR>
Sincere – what else to expect from the innate archaic?<BR>
Sentient – massaged by the music, as well as I<BR>
Transdimensional – not saying too much or too little<BR>
Gentle – so, in fact, ties you to the bed<BR>
Malleating – somewhere, further in – animagaiic<BR>
Transplant – the onion synonym – centers and layers<BR>
Bizarre – peeling projections that are literalized realities<BR>
Wordless – entrenched in such a matrix of Babel<BR>
Profound – third eye, face down, and fontanelle<BR>
Challenging – the content of forgotten origins<BR>
Communicative – I have a question and am encouraged<BR>
Affirmative – we are not low-tech prosthetics<BR>
Beauty – its design elements I’ve long ignored<BR>
Transient – lingering to fading – memorous rejuvenating<BR>
Humble – so, in fact, an encounter of anxious symbiosis<BR>
Humbling – what can one say?<BR>
Formative – this, hindsightery of peripheral purgery<P>
