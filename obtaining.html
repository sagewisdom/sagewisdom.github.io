I highly encourage people to grow their own <I>Salvia divinorum</I> plants and to share cuttings with others. Plants are available from a growing number of specialty nurseries. Since it can be propagated easily from a small cutting, you may be able to get a free plant if you know someone already growing it. <I>Salvia divinorm</I> is a relatively easy plant to grow, but before growing it you should get some <A HREF="salvgrow.html">horticultural advice</A>.<p>

To grow and care for one's own plants creates a mutually nurturing relationship, one that engenders a sense of respect for the plant as a living organism. The experience of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> is in part influenced by the circumstances of its acquisition, as well as one's relationship to its source. These factors are important, because they influence the mental framework with which one approaches the experience (i.e. "set"). Growing one's own plants and harvesting the leaves in a respectful manner is particularly meaningful to people who think of the plant as a sacred entity. By growing your own, you will have a constant supply of leaves that can be consumed in the traditional way—fresh, which is one of the safest and most rewarding methods for using this herb.<p>
<br>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Purchasing leaves and extracts</FONT></B></CENTER><br>

If you are unable to grow the plant, want to obtain specially prepared extracts, or if you simply want to experiment with <I>Salvia divinorum</I> to see if you like it before putting the energy into growing it, you will probably need to purchase it from a commercial supplier. Many people (including myself) are uncomfortable about the commercialization and exploitation of sacred plants. The profound experiences they afford should not be pushed on to anybody. Too often, vendors sell <I>Salvia divinorum</I> with no information about proper preparation, safety, or effects. To do so is irresponsible. As a consumer, it is important that you trust your supplier and feel comfortable that your money is being spent wisely.<p><br>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2"><I>Salvia divinorum</I> Leaves</FONT></B></CENTER><br>
Leaf quality and potency can vary tremendously. It is usually best to purchase the most potent grade of leaf that you can afford. Before you decide to order, please read the following <A HREF="smokeadvice.html">information about smoked <I>Salvia divinorum</I></A>.<P><BR>


<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Extract enhanced leaf (fortified leaf)</FONT></B></CENTER><br>

Many people enjoy the effects of smoked <I>Salvia divinorum</I>. However, it can be difficult to achieve a satisfactory level of effects from the leaf in its natural state because of the large quantities of smoke that must be inhaled. Fortified leaves make it possible to achieve effects much more easily. <p>

Several vendors now offer various forms of fortified leaf products. These are prepared by combining <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves with some form of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> extract. Sometimes these products are simply labeled "extract", but the correct term is "fortified leaf" or "extract enhanced leaf". These products fall into two categories:<P>

<U><B>Crude extract enhanced leaf</B></U> A common product currently on the market is called "5X". It is prepared by adding the tar-like crude extract obtained from 4 units of leaf back onto 1 unit of leaf. The resulting product is thus 5 times as potent as the leaves used to produce it. This type of product is  variable in potency because the potency of the leaves used to produce it varies. It has a somewhat sticky feel and inferior burning characteristics due to the impure quality of the extract. This type of product concentrates tars and other potentially harmful components of the leaf.<p>

<U><B>Standardized salvinorin A enhanced leaf.</B></U> This is prepared by extracting pure salvinorin A (the active principal of the plant), then adding a measured quantity back onto <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves to bring them up to a specific, reliable, and consistent level of potency. This type of product is time-consumming to prepare, but is far supperior to crude extract enhance leaf. Products that have been prepared in this manner have particularly good burning characteristics because they do not contain the tar-like, gummy impurities found in crude extracts. Since the impurities have been removed during the extraction process, they won't end up in your lungs.<p>

Fortified leaf products allow one to explore deeper levels than are available using plain leaf. This is particularly important for people who find that they are not very sensitive to <I>Salvia divinorum</I>. Another advantage to these products is that they are far easier to consume, since less material needs to be ingested or smoked. Fortified leaf products can be quite powerful and must be used carefully. I generally recommend that people avoid using products containing more than 15 mg salvinorin A per gram of leaf, unless the dose has been weighed precisely.<p><br>

The Mazatecs of Central Mexico use this herb only with a clear intent and purpose. It is always used under the supervision of an experienced shaman. It is used this way for good reasons. Since Mazatec shamans are probably not available to guide you through your own <I>Salvia divinorum</I> experiments, it is essential that you educate yourself as well as possible before deciding to work with it. Talk to others who are already experienced with its effects, read books, and look for information on the Internet. A good starting place is <A HREF="index.html">The <I>Salvia divinorum</I> Research and Information Center</A>.
