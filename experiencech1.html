I found myself on a beach while under the influence of smoked <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaf.
I managed to forget that I had smoked salvia and I "woke up" on this beach. It
was so bright that I looked at the sand and each grain of sand turned into a
star and I was bathed in peircing light. The light was so bright that I became
disoriented and I thought I was walking on a sidewalk against the side of a
building and the sun was reflecting off the cement, which I assumed was
creating the bright lighting. Then the sidewalk and the wall began to
"squeeze" me and I became sandwiched between the two planes and felt like I
was being crushed. I immediatley became somnambulent and took a little walk
around my living room, which to me appeared to be a series of interconnecting
labyrinths. As I sat back down on the couch, I could see the room with my eyes
open and I finally remembered that I had smoked salvia.
