R. Gordon Wasson, with whom I had maintained friendly relations since the<BR>
investigations of the Mexican magic mushrooms, invited my wife and me to take<BR>
part in an expedition to Mexico in the fall of 1962. The purpose of the<BR>
journey was to search for another Mexican magic plant. Wasson had learned on<BR>
his travels in the mountains of southern Mexico that the expressed juice of<BR>
the leaves of a plant, which were called hojas de la Pastora or hojas de Maria<BR>
Pastora, in Mazatec ska Pastora or ska Maria Pastora (leaves of the<BR>
shepherdess or leaves of Mary the shepherdess), were used among the Mazatec in<BR>
medico-religious practices, like the teonanacatl mushrooms and the ololiuhqui<BR>
seeds.<BR>
<BR>
The question now was to ascertain from what sort of plant the &quot;leaves of Mary<BR>
the shepherdess&quot; derived, and then to identify this plant botanically. We also<BR>
hoped, if at all possible, to gather sufficient plant material to conduct a<BR>
chemical investigation on the hallucinogenic principles it contained.<BR>

On 26 September 1962, my wife and I accordingly flew to Mexico City, where we<BR>
met Gordon Wasson. He had made all the necessary preparations for the<BR>
expedition, so that in two days we had already set out on the next leg of the<BR>
journey to the south. Mrs. Irmgard Weitlaner Johnson, (widow of Jean B.<BR>
Johnson, a pioneer of the ethnographic study of the Mexican magic mushrooms,<BR>
killed in the Allied landing in North Africa) had joined us. Her father,<BR>
Robert J. Weitlaner, had emigrated to Mexico from Austria and had likewise<BR>
contributed toward the rediscovery of the mushroom cult. Mrs. Johnson worked<BR>
at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, as an expert on Indian<BR>
textiles.<BR>
<BR>
After a two-day journey in a spacious Land Rover, which took us over the<BR>
plateau, along the snow-capped Popocatepetl, passing Puebla, down into the<BR>
Valley of Orizaba with its magnificent tropical vegetation, then by ferry<BR>
across the Popoloapan (Butterfly River), on through the former Aztec garrison<BR>
Tuxtepec, we arrived at the starting point of our expedition, the Mazatec<BR>
village of Jalapa de Diaz, lying on a hillside.<BR>
<BR>
There we were in the midst of the environment and among the people that we<BR>
would come to know in the succeeding 2 1/2 weeks.<BR>
<BR>
There was an uproar upon our arrival in the marketplace, center of this<BR>
village widely dispersed in the jungle. Old and young men, who had been<BR>
squatting and standing around in the half-opened bars and shops, pressed<BR>
suspiciously yet curiously about our Land Rover; they were mostly barefoot but<BR>
all wore a sombrero. Women and girls were nowhere to be seen. One of the men<BR>
gave us to understand that we should follow. him. He led us to the local<BR>
president, a fat mestizo who had his office in a one-story house with a<BR>
corrugated iron roof. Gordon showed him our credentials from the civil<BR>
authorities and from the military governor of Oaxaca, which explained that we<BR>
had come here to carry out scientific investigations. The president, who<BR>
probably could not read at all, was visibly impressed by the large-sized<BR>
documents equipped with official seals. He had lodgings assigned to us in a<BR>
spacious shed, in which we could place our air mattresses and sleeping bags.<BR>
<BR>
I looked around the region somewhat. The ruins of a large church from colonial<BR>
times, which must have once been very beautiful, rose almost ghostlike in the<BR>
direction of an ascending slope at the side of the village square. Now I could<BR>
also see women looking out of their huts, venturing to examine the strangers.<BR>
In their long, white dresses, adorned with red borders, and with their long<BR>
braids of blue-black hair, they offered a picturesque sight.<BR>
<BR>
We-were fed by an old Mazatec woman, who directed a young cook and two<BR>
helpers. She lived in one of the typical Mazatec huts. These are simply<BR>
rectangular structures with thatched gabled roofs and walls of wooden poles<BR>
joined together, windowless, the chinks between the wooden poles offering<BR>
sufficient opportunity to look out. In the middle of the hut, on the stamped<BR>
clay floor, was an elevated, open fireplace, built up out of dried clay or<BR>
made of stones. The smoke escaped through large openings in the walls under<BR>
the two ends of the roof. Bast mats that lay in a corner or along the walls<BR>
served as beds. The huts were shared with the domestic animals, as well as<BR>
black swine, turkeys, and chickens. There was roasted chicken to eat, black<BR>
beans, and also, in place of bread, tortittas, a type of cornmeal pancake that<BR>
is baked on the hot stone slab of the hearth. Beer and tequila, an Agave<BR>
liquor, were served.<BR>
<BR>
Next morning our troop formed for the ride through the Sierra Mazateca. Mules<BR>
and guides were engaged from the horsekeeper of the village. Guadelupe, the<BR>
Mazatec familiar with the route, took charge of guiding the lead animal.<BR>
Gordon, Irmgard, my wife, and I were stationed on our mules in the middle.<BR>
Teodosio and Pedro, called Chico, two young fellows who trotted along barefoot<BR>
beside the two mules laden with our baggage, brought up the rear.<BR>
<BR>
It took some time to get accustomed to the hard wooden saddles. Then, however,<BR>
this mode of locomotion proved to be the most ideal type of travel that I know<BR>
of. The mules followed the leader, single file, at a steady pace. They<BR>
required no direction at all by the rider. With surprising dexterity, they<BR>
sought out the best spots along the almost impassable, partly rocky, partly<BR>
marshy paths, which led through thickets and streams or onto precipitous<BR>
slopes. Relieved of all travel cares, we could devote all our attention to the<BR>
beauty of the landscape and the tropical vegetation. There were tropical<BR>
forests with gigantic trees overgrown with twining plants, then again<BR>
clearings with banana groves or coffee plantations, between light stands of<BR>
trees, flowers at the edge of the path, over which wondrous butterflies<BR>
bustled about.... We made our way upstream along the broad riverbed of Rio<BR>
Santo Domingo, with brooding heat and steamy air, now steeply ascending, then<BR>
again falling. During a short, violent tropical downpour, the long broad<BR>
ponchos of oilcloth, with which Gordon had equipped us, proved quite useful.<BR>
Our Indian guides had protected themselves from the cloudburst with gigantic,<BR>
heart-shaped leaves that they nimbly chopped off at the edge of the path.<BR>
Teodosio and Chico gave the impression of great, green hay ricks as they ran,<BR>
covered with these leaves, beside their mules.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before nightfall we arrived at the first settlement, La Providencia<BR>
ranch. The patron, Don Joaquin Garcia, the head of a large family, welcomed us<BR>
hospitably and full of dignity. It was impossible to determine how many<BR>
children, in addition to the grown-ups and the domestic animals, were present<BR>
in the large living room, feebly illuminated by the hearth fire alone.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon and I placed our sleeping bags outdoors under the projecting roof. I<BR>
awoke in the morning to find a pig grunting over my face.<BR>
<BR>
After another day's journey on the backs of our worthy mules, we arrived at<BR>
Ayautla, a Mazatec settlement spread across a hillside. En route, among the<BR>
shrubbery, I had delighted in the blue calyxes of the magic morning glory<BR>
Ipomoea violacea, the mother plant of the ololiuhqui seeds. It grew wild<BR>
there, whereas among us it is only found in the Garden as an ornamental plant.<BR>
<BR>
We remained in Ayautla for several days. We had lodging in the house of Dona<BR>
Donata Sosa de Garcia. Dona Donata was in charge of a large family, which<BR>
included her ailing husband. In addition, she presided over the coffee<BR>
cultivation of the region. The collection center for the freshly picked coffee<BR>
beans was in an adjacent building. It was a lovely picture, the young Indian<BR>
woman and girls returning home from the harvest toward evening, in their<BR>
bright garments adorned with colored borders, the coffee sacks carried on<BR>
their backs by headbands. Dona Donata also managed a type of grocery store, in<BR>
which her husband, Don Eduardo, stood behind the counter.<BR>
<BR>
In the evening by candlelight, Dona Donata, who besides Mazatec also spoke<BR>
Spanish, told us about life in the village; one tragedy or another had already<BR>
struck nearly every one of the seemingly peaceful huts that lay surrounded by<BR>
this paradisiacal scenery. A man who had murdered his wife, and who now sits<BR>
in prison for life, had lived in the house next door, which now stood empty.<BR>
The husband of a daughter of Dona Donata, after an affair with another woman,<BR>
was murdered out of jealousy. The president of Ayautla, a young bull of a<BR>
mestizo, to whom we had made our formal visit in the afternoon, never made the<BR>
short walk from his hut to his &quot;office&quot; in the village hall (with the<BR>
corrugated iron roof) unless accompanied by two heavily armed men. Because he<BR>
exacted illegal taxes, he was afraid of being shot to death. Since no higher<BR>
authority sees to justice in this remote region, people have recourse to<BR>
self-defense of this type.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to Dona Donata's good connections, we received the first sample of the<BR>
sought-after plant, some leaves of hojas de la Pastora, from an old woman.<BR>
Since the flowers and roots were missing, however, this plant material was not<BR>
suitable for botanical identification. Our efforts to obtain more precise<BR>
information about the habitat of the plant and its use were also fruitless.<BR>
<BR>
The continuation of our journey from Ayautla was delayed, as we had to wait<BR>
until our boys could again bring back the mules that they had taken to pasture<BR>
on the other side of Rio Santo Domingo, over the river swollen by intense<BR>
downpours.<BR>
<BR>
After a two-day ride, on which we had passed the night in the high mountain<BR>
village of San MiguelHuautla, we arrived at Rio Santiago. Here we were joined<BR>
by Dona Herlinda Martinez Cid, a teacher from Huautla de Jimenez. She had<BR>
ridden over on the invitation of Gordon Wasson, who had known her since his<BR>
mushroom expeditions, and was to serve as our Mazatec and Spanish-speaking<BR>
interpreter. Moreover, she could help us, through her numerous relatives<BR>
scattered in the region, to pave the way to contacts with curanderos and<BR>
curanderas who used the hojas de 1a Pastora in their practice. Because of our<BR>
delayed arrival in Rio Santiago, Dona Herlinda, who was acquainted with the<BR>
dangers of the region, had been apprehensive about us, fearing we might have<BR>
plunged down a rocky path or been attacked by robbers.<BR>
<BR>
Our next stop was in San Jose Tenango, a settlement lying deep in a valley, in<BR>
the midst of tropical vegetation with orange and lemon trees and banana<BR>
plantations. Here again was the typical village picture: in the center, a<BR>
marketplace with a half-ruined church from the colonial period, with two or<BR>
three stands, a general store, and shelters for horses and mules. We found<BR>
lodging in a corrugated iron barracks, with the special luxury of a cement<BR>
floor, on which we could spread out our sleeping bags.<BR>
<BR>
In the thick jungle on the mountainside we discovered a s-pring, whose<BR>
magnificent fresh water in a natural rocky basin invited us to bathe. That was<BR>
an unforgettable pleasure after days without opportunities to wash properly.<BR>
In this grotto I saw a hummingbird for the first time in nature, a blue-green,<BR>
metallic, iridescent gem, which whirred over great liana blossoms.<BR>
<BR>
The desired contact with persons skilled in medicine came about thanks to the<BR>
kindred connections of Dona Herlinda, beginning with the curandero Don Sabino.<BR>
But he refused, for some reason, to receive us in a consultation and to<BR>
question the leaves. From an old curandera, a venerable woman in a strikingly<BR>
magnificent Mazatec garment, with the lovely name Natividad Rosa, we received<BR>
a whole bundle of flowering specimens of the sought-after plant, but even she<BR>
could not be prevailed upon to perform a ceremony with the leaves for us. Her<BR>
excuse was that she was too old for the hardship of the magical trip; she<BR>
could never cover the long distance to certain places: a spring where the wise<BR>
women gather their powers, a lake on which the sparrows sing, and where<BR>
objects get their names. Nor would Natividad Rosa tell us where she had<BR>
gathered the leaves. They grew in a very, very distant forest valley. Wherever<BR>
she dug up a plant, she put a coffee bean in the earth as thanks to the gods.<BR>
<BR>
We now possessed ample plants with flowers and roots, which were suitable for<BR>
botanical identification. It was apparently a representative of the genus<BR>
Salvia, a relative of the well-known meadow sage. The plants had blue flowers<BR>
crowned with a white dome, which are arranged on a panicle 20 to 30 cm long,<BR>
whose stem leaked blue.<BR>
<BR>
Several days later, Natividad Rosa brought us a whole basket of leaves, for<BR>
which she was paid fifty pesos. The business seemed to have been discussed,<BR>
for two other women brought us further quantities of leaves. As it was known<BR>
that the expressed juice of the leaves is drunk in the ceremony, and this must<BR>
therefore contain the active principle, the fresh leaves were crushed on a<BR>
stone plate, squeezed out in a cloth, the juice diluted with alcohol as a<BR>
preservative, and decanted into flasks in order to be studied later in the<BR>
laboratory in Basel. I was assisted in this work by an Indian girl, who was<BR>
accustomed to dealing with the stone plate, the metate, on which the Indians<BR>
since ancient times have ground their corn by hand.<BR>
<BR>
On the day before the journey was to continue, having given up all hope of<BR>
being able to attend a ceremony, we suddenly made another contact with a<BR>
curandera, one who was ready &quot; to serve us .&quot; A confidante of Herlinda's, who<BR>
had produced this contact, led us after nightfall along a secret path to the<BR>
hut of the curandera, lying solitary on the mountainside above the settlement.<BR>
No one from the village was to see us or discover that we were received there.<BR>
It was obviously considered a betrayal of sacred customs, worthy of<BR>
punishment, to allow strangers, whites, to take part in this. That indeed had<BR>
also been the real reason why the other healers whom we asked had refused to<BR>
admit us to a leaf ceremony. Strange birdcalls from the darkness accompanied<BR>
us on the ascent, and the barking of dogs was heard on all sides. The dogs had<BR>
detected the strangers. The curandera Consuela Garcia, a woman of some forty<BR>
years, barefoot like all Indian women in this region, timidly admitted us to<BR>
her hut and immediately closed up the doorway with a heavy bar. She bid us lie<BR>
down on the bast mats on the stamped mud floor. As Consuela spoke only<BR>
Mazatec, Herlinda translated her instructions into Spanish for us. The<BR>
curandera lit a candle on a table covered with some images of saints, along<BR>
with a variety of rubbish. Then she began to bustle about busily, but in<BR>
silence. All at once we heard peculiar noises and a rummaging in the room-did<BR>
the hut harbor some hidden person whose shape and proportions could not be<BR>
made out in the candlelight? Visibly disturbed, Consuela searched the room<BR>
with the burning candle. It appeared to be merely rats, however, who were<BR>
working their mischief. In a bowl the curandera now kindled copal, an<BR>
incense-like resin, which soon filled the whole hut with its aroma. Then the<BR>
magic potion was ceremoniously prepared. Consuela inquired which of us wished<BR>
to drink of it with her. Gordon announced himself. Since I was suffering from<BR>
a severe stomach upset at the time, I could not join in. My wife substituted<BR>
for me. The curandera laid out six pairs of leaves for herself. She<BR>
apportioned the same number to Gordon. Anita received three pairs. Like the<BR>
mushrooms, the leaves are always dosed in pairs, a practice that, of course,<BR>
has a magical significance. The leaves were crushed with the metate, then<BR>
squeezed out through a fine sieve into a cup, and the metate and the contents<BR>
of the sieve were rinsed with water. Finally, the filled cups were incensed<BR>
over the copal vessel with much ceremony. Consuela asked Anita and Gordon,<BR>
before she handed them their cups, whether they believed in the truth and the<BR>
holiness of the ceremony. After they answered in the affirmative and the very<BR>
bitter-tasting potion was solemnly imbibed, the candles were extinguished and,<BR>
lying in darkness on the bast masts, we awaited the effects.<BR>
<BR>
After some twenty minutes Anita whispered to me that she saw striking,<BR>
brightly bordered images. Gordon also perceived the effect of the drug. The<BR>
voice of the curandera sounded from the darkness, half speaking, half singing.<BR>
Herlinda translated: Did we believe in Christ's blood and the holiness of the<BR>
rites? After our &quot;creemos&quot; (&quot;We believe&quot;), the ceremonial performance<BR>
continued. The curandera lit the candles, moved them from the &quot;altar table&quot;<BR>
onto the floor, sang and spoke prayers or magic formulas, placed the candles<BR>
again under the images of the saints-then again silence and darkness.<BR>
Thereupon the true consultation began. Consuela asked for our request. Gordon<BR>
inquired after the health of his daughter, who immediately before his<BR>
departure from New York had to be admitted prematurely to the hospital in<BR>
expectation of a baby. He received the comforting information that mother and<BR>
child were well. Then again came singing and prayer and manipulations with the<BR>
candles on the &quot;altar table&quot; and on the floor, over the smoking basin.<BR>
<BR>
When the ceremony was at an end, the curandera asked us to rest yet a while<BR>
longer in prayer on our bast mats. Suddenly a thunderstorm burst out. Through<BR>
the cracks of the beam walls, lightning flashed into the darkness of the hut,<BR>
accompanied by violent thunderbolts, while a tropical downpour raged, beating<BR>
on the roof. Consuela voiced apprehension that we would not be able to leave<BR>
her house unseen in the darkness. But the thunderstorm let up before daybreak,<BR>
and we went down the mountainside to our corrugated iron barracks, as<BR>
noiselessly as possible by the light of flashlights, unnoticed by the<BR>
villagers, but dogs again barked from all sides.<BR>
<BR>
Participation in this ceremony was the climax of our expedition. It brought<BR>
confirmation that the hojas de la Pastora were used by the Indians for the<BR>
same purpose and in the same ceremonial milieu as teonanacatl, the sacred<BR>
mushrooms. Now we also had authentic plant material, not only sufficient for<BR>
botanical identification, but also for the planned chemical analysis. The<BR>
inebriated state that Gordon Wasson and my wife had experienced with the hojas<BR>
had been shallow and only of short duration, yet it had exhibited a distinctly<BR>
hallucinogenic character.<BR>
<BR>
On the morning after this eventful night we took leave of San Jose Tenango.<BR>
The guide, Guadelupe, and the two fellows Teodosio and Pedro appeared before<BR>
our barracks with the mules at the appointed time. Soon packed up and mounted,<BR>
our little troop then moved uphill again, through the fertile landscape<BR>
glittering in the sunlight from the night's thunderstorm. Returning by way of<BR>
Santiago, toward evening we reached our last stop in Mazatec country, the<BR>
capital Huautla de Jimenez.<BR>
<BR>
From here on, the return trip to Mexico City was made by automobile. With a<BR>
final supper in the Posada Rosaura, at the time the only inn in Huautla, we<BR>
took leave of our Indian guides and of the worthy mules that had carried us so<BR>
surefootedly and in such a pleasant way through the Sierra Mazatec. The<BR>
Indians were paid of, and Teodosio, who also accepted payment for his chief in<BR>
Jalapa de Diaz (where the animals were to be returned afterward), gave a<BR>
receipt with his thumbprint colored by a ballpoint pen. We took up quarters in<BR>
Dona Herlinda's house.<BR>
<BR>
A day later we made our formal visit to the curandera Maria Sabina, a woman<BR>
made famous by the Wassons' publications. It had been in her hut that Gordon<BR>
Wasson became the first white man to taste of the sacred mushrooms, in the<BR>
course of a nocturnal ceremony in the summer of 1955. Gordon and Maria Sabina<BR>
greeted each other cordially, as old friends. The curandera lived out of the<BR>
way, on the mountainside above Huautla. The house in which the historic<BR>
session with Gordon Wasson had taken place had been burned, presumably by<BR>
angered residents or an envious colleague, because she had divulged the secret<BR>
of teonanacatl to strangers. In the new hut in which we found ourselves, an<BR>
incredible disorder prevailed, as had probably also prevailed in the old hut,<BR>
in which half-naked children, hens, and pigs bustled about. The old curandera<BR>
had an intelligent face, exceptionally changeable in expression. She was<BR>
obviously impressed when it was explained that we had managed to confine the<BR>
spirit of the mushrooms in pills, and she at once declared herself ready to &quot;<BR>
serve us&quot; with these, that is, to grant us a consultation. It was agreed that<BR>
this should take place the coming night in the house of Dona Herlinda.<BR>
<BR>
In the course of the day I took a stroll through Huautla de Jimenez, which led<BR>
along a main street on the mountainside. Then I accompanied Gordon on his<BR>
visit to the Instituto Nacional Indigenista. This governmental organization<BR>
had the duty of studying and helping to solve the problems of the indigenous<BR>
population, that is, the Indians. Its leader told us of the difficulties that<BR>
the &quot;coffee policy&quot; had caused in the area at that time. The president of<BR>
Huautla, in collaboration with the Instituto Nacional Indigenista had tried to<BR>
eliminate middlemen in order to shape the coffee prices favorably for the<BR>
producing Indians. His body was found, mutilated, the previous June.<BR>
<BR>
Our stroll also took us past the cathedral, from which Gregorian chants<BR>
resounded. Old Father Aragon, whom Gordon knew well from his earlier stays,<BR>
invited us into the vestry for a glass of tequila.<BR>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="4">A Mushroom Ceremony</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><BR>
As we returned home to Herlinda's house toward evening, Maria Sabina had<BR>
already arrived there with a large company, her two lovely daughters, Apolonia<BR>
and Aurora (two prospective curanderas), and a niece, all of whom brought<BR>
children along with them. Whenever her child began to cry, Apolonia would<BR>
offer her breast to it. The old curandero Don Aurelio also appeared, a mighty<BR>
man, one-eyed, in a black-andwhite patternedserape (cloak). Cacao and sweet<BR>
pastry were served on the veranda. I was reminded of the report from an<BR>
ancient chronicle which described how chocotatl was drunk before the ingestion<BR>
of teonanacatl.<BR>
<BR>
After the fall of darkness, we all proceeded into the room in which the<BR>
ceremony would take place. It was then locked up-that is, the door was<BR>
obstructed with the only bed available. Only an emergency exit into the back<BR>
garden remained unlatched for absolute necessity. It was nearly midnight when<BR>
the ceremony began. Until that time the whole party lay, in darkness sleeping<BR>
or awaiting the night's events, on the bast mats spread on the floor. Maria<BR>
Sabina threw a piece of copal on the embers of a brazier from time to time,<BR>
whereby the stuffy air in the crowded room became somewhat bearable. I had<BR>
explained to the curandera through Herlinda, who was again with the party as<BR>
interpreter, that one pill contained the spirit of two pairs of mushrooms.<BR>
(The pills contained 5.0 mg synthetic psilocybin apiece.)<BR>
<BR>
When all was ready, Maria Sabina apportioned the pills in pairs among the<BR>
grown-ups present. After solemn smoking, she herself took two pairs<BR>
(corresponding to 20 mg psilocybin). She gave the same dose to Don Aurelio and<BR>
her daughter Apolonia, who would also serve as curandera. Aurora received one<BR>
pair, as did Gordon, while my wife and Irmgard got only one pill each.<BR>
<BR>
One of the children, a girl of about ten, under the guidance of Maria Sabina,<BR>
had prepared for me the juice of five pairs of fresh leaves of hojas de la<BR>
Pastora. I wanted to experience this drug that I had been unable to try in San<BR>
Jose Tenango. The potion was said to be especially active when prepared by an<BR>
innocent child. The cup with the expressed juice was likewise incensed and<BR>
conjured by Maria Sabina and Don Aurelio, before it was delivered to me.<BR>
<BR>
All of these preparations and the following ceremony progressed in much the<BR>
same way as the consultation with the curandera Consuela Garcia in San Jose<BR>
Tenango.<BR>
<BR>
After the drug was apportioned and the candle on the &quot; altar&quot; was<BR>
extinguished, we awaited the effects in the darkness.<BR>
<BR>
Before a half hour had elapsed, the curandera murmured something; her daughter<BR>
and Don Aurelio also became restless. Herlinda translated and explained to us<BR>
what was wrong. Maria Sabina had said that the pills lacked the spirit of the<BR>
mushrooms. I discussed the situation with Gordon, who lay beside me. For us it<BR>
was clear that absorption of the active principle from the pills, which must<BR>
first dissolve in the stomach, occurs more slowly than from the mushrooms, in<BR>
which some of the active principle already becomes absorbed through the mucous<BR>
membranes during chewing. But how could we give a scientific explanation under<BR>
such conditions? Rather than try to explain, we decided to act. We distributed<BR>
more pills. Both curanderas and the curandero each received another pair. They<BR>
had now each taken a total dosage of 30 mg psilocybin.<BR>
<BR>
After about another quarter of an hour, the spirit of the pills did begin to<BR>
yield its effects, which lasted until the crack of dawn. The daughters, and<BR>
Don Aurelio with his deep bass voice, fervently answered the prayers and<BR>
singing of the curandera. Blissful, yearning moans of Apolonia and Aurora,<BR>
between singing and prayer, gave the impression that the religious experience<BR>
of the young women in the drug inebriation was combined with sensual-sexual<BR>
feelings.<BR>
<BR>
In the middle of the ceremony Maria Sabina asked for our request. Gordon<BR>
inquired again after the health of his daughter and grandchild. He received<BR>
the same good information as from the curandera Consuela. Mother and child<BR>
were in fact well when he returned home to New York. Obviously, however, this<BR>
still represents no proof of the prophetic abilities of both curanderas.<BR>
<BR>
Evidently as an effect of the hojas, I found myself for some time in a state<BR>
of mental sensitivity and intense experience, which, however, was not<BR>
accompanied by hallucinations. Anita, Irmgard, and Gordon experienced a<BR>
euphoric condition of inebriation that was influenced by tke strange, mystical<BR>
atmosphere. My wife was impressed by the vision of very distinct strange line<BR>
patterns.<BR>
<BR>
She was astonished and perplexed, later, on discovering precisely the same<BR>
images in the rich ornamentation over the altar in an old church near Puebla.<BR>
That was on the return trip to Mexico City, when we visited churches from<BR>
colonial times. These admirable churches offer great cultural and historical<BR>
interest because the Indian artists and workmen who assisted in their<BR>
construction smuggled in elements of Indian style. Klaus Thomas, in his book<BR>
Die kunstlich gesteuerte Seele [The artificially steered mind] (Ferdinand Enke<BR>
Verlag, Stuttgart, 1970), writes about the possible influence of visions from<BR>
psilocybin inebriation on Meso-American Indian art: &quot;Surely a<BR>
culturalhistorical comparison of the old and new creations of Indian art . . .<BR>
must convince the unbiased spectator of the harmony with the images, forms and<BR>
colors of a psilocybin inebriation.&quot; The Mexican character of the visions seen<BR>
in my first experience with dried Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms and the drawing<BR>
of Li Gelpke after a psilocybin inebriation could also point to such an<BR>
association.<BR>
<BR>
As we took leave of Maria Sabina and her clan at the crack of dawn, the<BR>
curandera said that the pills had the same power as the mushrooms, that there<BR>
was no difference. This was a confirmation from the most competent authority,<BR>
that the synthetic psilocybin is identical with the natural product. As a<BR>
parting gift I let Maria Sabina have a vial of psilocybin pills. She radiantly<BR>
explained to our interpreter Herlinda that she could now give consultations<BR>
even in the season when no mushrooms grow.<BR>
<BR>
How should we judge the conduct of Maria Sabina, the fact that she allowed<BR>
strangers, white people, access to the secret ceremony, and let them try the<BR>
sacred mushroom?<BR>
<BR>
To her credit it can be said that she had thereby opened the door to the<BR>
exploration of the Mexican mushroom cult in its present form, and to the<BR>
scientific, botanical, and chemical investigation of the sacred mushrooms.<BR>
Valuable active substances, psilocybin and psilocin, resulted. Without this<BR>
assistance, the ancient knowledge and experience that was concealed in these<BR>
secret practices would possibly, even probably, have disappeared without a<BR>
trace, without having borne fruit, in the advancement of Western civilization.<BR>
<BR>
From another standpoint, the conduct of this curandera can be regarded as a<BR>
profanation of a sacred custom-even as a betrayal. Some of her countrymen were<BR>
of this opinion, which was expressed in acts of revenge, including the burning<BR>
of her house.<BR>
<BR>
The profanation of the mushroom cult did not stop with the scientific<BR>
investigations. The publication about the magic mushrooms unleashed an<BR>
invasion of hippies and drug seekers into the Mazatec country, many of whom<BR>
behaved badly, some even criminally. Another undesirable consequence was the<BR>
beginning of true tourism in Huautla de Jimenez, whereby the originality of<BR>
the place was eradicated.<BR>
<BR>
Such statements and considerations are, for the most part, the concern of<BR>
ethnographical research. Wherever researchers and scientists trace and<BR>
elucidate the remains of ancient customs that are becoming rarer, their<BR>
primitiveness is lost. This loss is only more or less counterbalanced when the<BR>
outcome of the research represents a lasting cultural gain.<BR>
<BR>
From Huautla de Jimenez we proceeded first to Teotitlan, in a breakneck truck<BR>
ride along a half-paved road, and from there went on a comfortable car trip<BR>
back to Mexico City, the starting point of our expedition. I had lost several<BR>
kilograms in body weight, but was overwhelmingly compensated in enchanting<BR>
experiences.<BR>
<BR>
The herbarium samples of hojas de la Pastora, which we had brought with us,<BR>
were subjected to botanical indentification by Carl Epling and Carlos D.<BR>
Jativa at the Botanical Institute of Harvard University in Cambridge,<BR>
Massachusetts. They found that this plant was a hitherto undescribed species<BR>
of Satvia, which was named Salvia divinorum by these authors. The chemical<BR>
investigation of the juice of the magic sage in the laboratory in Basel was<BR>
unsuccessful. The psychoactive principle of this drug seems to be a rather<BR>
unstable substance, since the juice prepared in Mexico and preserved with<BR>
alcohol proved in selfexperiments to be no longer active. Where the chemical<BR>
nature of the active principle is concerned, the problem of the magic plant<BR>
ska Maria Pastora still awaits solution.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So far in this book I have mainly described my scientific work and matters<BR>
relating to my professional activity. But this work, by its very nature, had<BR>
repercussions on my own life and personality, not least because it brought me<BR>
into contact with interesting and important contemporaries. I have already<BR>
mentioned some of them-Timothy Leary, Rudolf Gelpke, Gordon Wasson. Now, in<BR>
the pages that follow, I would like to emerge from the natural scientist's<BR>
reserve, in order to portray encounters which were personally meaningful to me<BR>
and which helped me solve questions posed by the substances I had discovered.<BR>
