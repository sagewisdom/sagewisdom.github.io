While nonalkaloidal constituents have been implicated as being at least partially responsible for the biological activity of several hallucinogenic plants,<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">2</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> little has been reported on the structure of such possible hallucinogens. The Mexican labiate <I>Salvia divinorum</I> (Epling and Jat&iacute;va-M.) is used in divinatory rites by the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico. An infusion prepared from the crushed fresh leaves of this plant (known locally as <I>ska Maria Pastora</I>) is used to induce &quot;visions&quot; and its psychotropic effects have been verified by a number of researchers.<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">3</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Furthermore, upon administration of large doses of the plant extract in animals, one observes behavioral patterns that resemble the &quot;intoxication&quot; the infusion produces in human beings. Despite previous investigations, the principle(s) responsible for this biological activity has never been identified.<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">4</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> We now report the isolation and the structures of the new neoclerodane diterpenes, divinorins A and B from <I>S. divinorum</I>. Divinorin A, the first clearly documented terpenoid,<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">5</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> exerts a sedative effect on mice when tested in a bioassay based on a modification of Hall's open field.<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">6</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><BR>
<BR>
Lyophilized, pulverized leaves (5.35 kg) of <I>S. divinorum</I> were extracted with ether. The nonpolar components were removed from the concentrated extract through partition between hexanes and 90% aqueous methanol. The dried methanolic fraction was crudely purified by silica gel flash column chromatography<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">7</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (hexanes-ethyl acetate 2/1). Further purification of the biologically active fractions by additional silica gel flash column chromatography (methylene chloride-methanol 20/1) followed by repeated recrystallization yielded pure divinorin A (<B>1</B>) (1.2 g) and B (<B>3</B>) 50mg.

The UV spectrum (211nm (</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">e</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> 5260)) was indicative of the presence of the furan moeity. This was further corroborated by the products from the hydrogenation reaction of divinorin A which was accompanied by hydrogenolysis at C-12. Thus, catalytic hydrogenation of divinorin A in methanol over 5% Pd/C provided quantitatively a stereoisomeric mixture (at C-13) of hexahydro derivatives <B>4</B>. Although it was difficult to determine the presence of a ketone group from the IR spectrum of divinorin A alone, as its carbonyl region is strongly absorbed due to the presence of three other carbonyl functionalities, the presence of a highly hindered ketone group in divinorin A became evident from the results of its sodium borohydride reduction. The sodium borohydride reduction of divinorin A was found to be extremely sluggish at room temperature, presumably due to the severe steric crowding near the ketone located at C-1. However reduction at higher temperatures produced the mixture of <B>2</B> (40%) and its stereoisomeric diol (40%). The latter appears to be stereoisomeric at C-8 and/or C-9, which evidently has resulted from its &quot;base promoted&quot; C-8/C-9 cleavage followed by reclosure prior to the reduction. The stereochemistry of the diol <B>2</B> was secured as identical with that of divinorin A by its conversion to the later via acetylation with acetic anhydride/pyridine, at room temperature, followed by oxidation with  pyridinium chlorochromate. In contrast, the same sequence of the reactions of the other diol gave a thus far undetermined stereoisomer of divinorin A.<BR>

Microanalysis was performed by Spang Microanalytical Laboratory, Eagle Harbor, MI. Melting points were taken on a Fisher Johns melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. The Ultraviolet spectrum was determined on a Hewlett-Packard 8450A UV/vis spectrophotometer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Model 281 spectrometer as potassium bromide (KBr) discs. Mass spectra were taken with a Finnigan Model 4023 GC/MS spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained on a Bruker WM360 spectrometer (360 MHz for <SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">1</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">H and 90.56 MHz for <SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">13</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">C) in CDCl<SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">3</SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> unless otherwise stated and all chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to internal tetramethylsilane.

Collection, Extraction, and Isolation.</B> Live specimens of <I>S. divinorum</I> were collected at Cerro Quemado (Sept. 3, 1979) and Cerro Rabon (March 7, 1980) in Oaxaca, Mexico. The plants were cultivated at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, The University of Michigan, in order to provide material for research.<BR>
<BR>
Fresh <I>Salvia</I> leaves (5.350 kg) were lyophilized and forced through 7- and 16-mesh screens yielding 674.1 g of powdered dry material. The powder was extracted in 30-40-g lots for 24 h with ethyl ether (1 L/lot) using a Soxhlet apparatus and dried in vacuo, giving a total of 27.51 g of ether extract. The extract was partitioned between hexanes (600 mL) and 90 % aqueous methanol (600 mL) for 48 h using a liquid/liquid extractor and yielded, after removal of the solvent in vacuo, a 7.41-g methanol fraction. The hexane fraction was repartitioned as above and the combined concentrated methanol fractions (9.36 g) were subjected to further purification by flash column chromatography.<BR>
<BR>
In a typical experiment, a Fischer Porter 2.5 x  25 cm column containing 55 g of silica gel (70-230 mesh) which had been treated with 2.75 mL of water, was equilibrated with the eluting solvent, hexanes/ethyl acetate (2/1). Five hundred milligrams of the methanolic fraction was adsorbed on 5 g of silica gel and carefully poured on the preequilibrated column. The eluting solvent was then forced (using nitrogen pressure) through the column at the flow rate of 25-35 mL/min and 100 mL fractions were collected. Each fraction was then followed by bioassay and fractions 4-9 were determined to be active. The 9.36 g of methanolic fraction yielded 2.349 g of desired crude material. The material recovered was further purified by using another flash column chromatography. Five hundred milligrams of the crudely purified methanol fraction, adsorbed on 5 g of silica gel, was added to the top of the 2.5 x 25 cm Fischer Porter column containing 55 g of silica gel which had been treated with 2.75 mL of water and preequilibrated with the eluting solvent, methylene chloride/methanol (20/1). The column was eluted at a rate of 25-35 mL/min with the aid of 5 psi of nitrogen pressure, and 25 mL fractions were collected. The biologically active fractions (fractions 3-5) were combined. The 2.349 g of starting material gave 1.515 g of impure diterpene mixture from which pure divinorin A (893 mg) was obtained after two recrystallizations from absolute ethanol. The combined mother liquors were subjected to preparative TLC purification (Merck GF-254, 15 x 1 mm plate, 20 x 20 cm, developed with CHCl<SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">3</SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">/MeOH/H<SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">2</SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">O, 100.10/1), which gave more divinorin A (305 mg, R<I><SUB></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">f</SUB></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> 0.63) and crude divinorin B.

The diol (<B>2</B>) 2-monoacetate (19 mg) , dissolved in 5 mL of methylene chloride, was placed in a 25-mL round bottomed flask and treated with 53 mg of PCC in 5 mL of methylene chloride at room temperature. After 30 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 mL of ether. The ether layer was recovered by decantation and the dark residue was extracted with 10 mL of ether. The combined ether layers were dried over sodium sulfate and the organic solvents removed in vacuo. The crude reaction products (20 mg) were purified via flash column chromatography [55 g of Merk silica gel, 230-400 mesh; eluted with hexane/EtOAc (3/2)] which yielded 10 mg of divinorin A (<B>1)</B> and 5 mg of diol (<B>2</B>) 2-monoacetate.<BR>

<B>Acetylation of Divinorin B (3). </B>Divinorin B (10 mg) dissolved in 5 mL of dry pyridine and placed in a 10-mL round bottomed flask, was treated with 0.5 mL of acetic anhydride at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 6 h at that temperature. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 mL of methanol and the mixture was poured into ice water (50 mL). The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with water and dried in vacuo. The crude product was recrystallized from absolute ethanol and found identical with divinorin A. <BR>

</CENTER><B>Note Added in Proof.</B> After the original submission of the manuscript we learned that Ortega et al. reported the structure of salvinorin which is identical with that of divinorin A described herein (Ortega, A.; Blount, J.F.; Manchand, P.S. <I>J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. I</I> <B>1982</B>, 2505). Therefore divinorins A and B should be called salvinorins A and B respectively.<BR>

Although it was reported that active fractions reacted with Ludy Tenger reagent (a modified Dragendorff's reagent) and possibly alkaloids, extensive work in our laboratory has shown that pharmacologically active extracts from <I>S. divinorum</I> do not contain alkaloids, nor were we able to isolate any alkaloids from the plant itself. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>	Infusions and tinctures of the green matter from <I>Lagochilus inebrians</I> Bge. are described as having pharmacological activity exhibited by hemostatic and sedative properties of a general nature that are in part attributed to the spiro ether-containing labdane, lagochilin, which as been isolated from the plant.

The following is a summary of our modified bioassay: Mice were dosed with various fractions of the extract and the animals' activities were observed in the field, which consisted of a 3-ft. circle divided into squares. Parameters measured were the number of squares entered (lines crossed), rearings on the hind legs, and time spent immobile. Divinorin A reduced all three measurements of activity, resembling that of <I>S. divinorum</I> in human beings.<SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">2c</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">  <BR>

<BR>
<LI>	Purified, recrystallized divinorin A has activity slightly stronger than the original plant extract, whereas divinorin B was inactive in this bioassay (this does not preclude the possibility of a different psychotropic activity in the latter). The mother liquor from recrystallization contains at least two more terpenoids in addition to these two divinorins. This mixture shows substantially stronger activity, thus suggesting the presence of a minor component(s) that either synergistically enhances the activity of divinorin A or has strong sedative properties in itself. Isolation of these minor components and identifying their activities is currently being pursued.<BR>
