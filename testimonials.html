I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your website and Sage 
Goddess Emerald Essence. You website is an incredibly excellent 
information source, and I've had some of the most beautiful and 
profoundly-inspiring psychedelic experiences of my life with your 
ingeniously-crafted, sublingual potion. Thank you so much for this!<P>

Best Wishes,<BR>

You may recall filling an order for me about a month ago for the SD tincture. I received and have read the tri-fold you mailed along with the SD User's Guide & FAQs posted on the Sagewisdom site. The information you have provided is comprehensive, accurate and fascinating. I've used the tincture on two occasions since receiving it and found it to be convenient, easy to use and of a potency that I hadn't expected. The combination of thoughfully articulated instructions along with a very high quality product was instrumental in setting the tone for and triggering powerful healing experiences. You are to be commended for your artisanship. A heartfelt thanks to you and keep up the good work.<P>

Bright Blessings<BR>

I do not normally write to a company (or individual) about a product, but my experience with Emerald Essence was just so unexpected that I had to write. I am a busy professional and have been trying to find ways to "de-stress" over the last couple years. I do exercise frequently and that helps immensely, but sometimes I found I was still very anxious and worried, and unable to sleep. I have tried Kava kava and Valerian, but not with a great deal of success. So I was quite skeptical when I started reading about "Diviners Sage." But I thought I would give it a try and ordered a bottle. I took 4 droppers (diluted) in  the early evening. The Emerald Essence COMPLETELY relaxed me and I had a very restful night of sleep. But it was the next day that astounded me. I felt so at peace with everyone and myself. NOTHING could upset me - bad traffic, agressive people, busy schedule, etc.  It was like I was IMMUNE to stress! I felt very sociable too, and was chatting up everyone!  My thought processes were clear - I was not foggy at all. It was more than I could have hoped for. I am very grateful you have introduced this product to the public, and I plan on purchasing more soon. Well done!<P>

I wanted to write you concerning SAGE GODDESS EMERALD 
ESSENCE.  I have bought various other products that have made claims of 
being genuine.  I must say that your product is the only one that ever 
delivered.  It's quality is top notch and it is beautifully crafted.  I 
consider it to be an etheogenical work of art.  You have made a loyal 
customer.  I would also like to thank you for all your contributions to 
the etheogen community.  My best wishes to you and the  Salvia Divinorum 
Research Center.<P>

Thank you<BR>

I just got my package of Emerald Essence in the mail and tried a "medium" dose. Let me tell you...it was one of the most profound, psychologically refreshing experiences of my life. It did not dissapoint and I found it much more valuable than the smoked <i>Salvia 
divinorum</i> I have done in the past. Thank you for creating/selling this. I 
hope you have a happy new year...I know I will.<P>

Your Sage Goddess Emerald Essence is great.  One low-dose session in conjunction with a sound-and-light machine had tremendous transformational effects. My intention is to start out by using the tincture in low doses for basic purification and balancing, what I might call emotional-bioenergetic balancing and integration of the psycho-physical vehicle, and your product works like a charm.  It felt like my auric-bioenergetic field was being purified and balanced. I am convinced from the results that salvia divinorum combines medicinal, psycho-theraputic, bioenergetic and spiritual healing properties.  I feel a definite increase in mental clarity, emotional well-being and overall psychophysical rejuvenation...from just one session. I am convinced that people are making a mistake in smoking 10x or higher leaves and rocketing into non-local hyperspace without first purifying, healing and learning from low-dose oral sessions.  My one experience of smoking 10x (second salvia experience; the first was smoking 1x) conclusively convinced me that such high-intensity experiences should only be undertaken after one is firmly grounded in what we might call the Sage Goddess' Teaching Program, a long-term program approached with humility, reverence and deep appreciation. I will be ordering more.  Thank-you for making this very pure, high-quality product available.<P>

Regards, Joseph

I would like to congratulate you. The extra strength extract is one of the most reliable and efficient methods of ingesting salvia have come across.<P>

I was very impressed with this visionary elixer. It's an exceptional work of Alchemy from the plant kingdom. It should prove to be a valuable tool for many.<P>

Thanks, James<P>

I think you've really made a real breakthrough with your Emerald
Essence. I've just been trying it at mild levels and found that, if taken an
hour or so before I go to sleep, I can sleep through the night without
waking (as I usually do), and in profound relaxation. My dreams seem also to
be of longer duration, and of more detail and complexity.<P>

I have concentration problems, so it is difficult for me to meditate. I use prescription medication for it, but it has terrible side effects. I bought your product (Emerald Essence), and I was able to meditate and think clearer. I will definitely buy this product again. Thank you very much!<P>

Last week your emrerald essance arrived. What an experience !  I just want to say thank you - I think 
the work you are doing is very important. I can now
divide my life into two halves - before Salvia and 
after Salvia. I must say I never expected to be so 
profoundly effected by your extract. Maybe I am just
super-sensitive to the active compound. I held six
dropper fulls under my tounge for approx. ten minutes.
I spit out what was left ( I had swallowed some of it )
and then the effects began. For fifteen minutes the 
veil of reality was lifted. What more can I say? Ive
had alot of experiences with LSD and psilocybin
but nothing could have prepared me for Salvia. I
look forward to smoking Salvia and will order some
leaves from you in the near future. Thanks again.<P>

I received from you the shipment of dried <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves yesterday. I was not
sure what to expect from smoking them. I had read much about the plant
and individual's experiences and, frankly, I was a bit scared. However,
my initial attempts last night yielded little more than a mild buzz. But
the set and setting were not right. My high-energy German Shepherd puppy
was distracting me and I was quite stressed. Later in the evening (after
my dog was asleep and I was relaxed), I retreated to my bedroom to give
it another go. I was thinking that this thing is a hoax - someone out
there selling bogus placebos (if it was so effective, it would have been
scheduled, etc.) Well, I loaded my glass bong and proceeded to take a
couple of massive hits in succession (which seems to be the most
effective m.o. according to the numerous trip reports). Well .... the
rest is history. It was the weirdest, wackiest experience of my life. I
was pulled into another dimension. Like on a downward roller coaster into
a strange vortex with streaking colors flying by. I was no longer on my
bed but floating swiftly through the air. I was not alone, but who was
there with me? Words cannot do justice to describing this experience.
The intense euphoria. The body rush. It was like a sensory orgasm. Thanks for your work and I look forward to my next journey.<P>

I am mighty pleased with the <i>Lagochilus inebrians.</i> It makes me feel ultra euphoric on just 3 grams, and although it tastes rather bitter, I feel the benefits outweigh the bitterness.<P>
