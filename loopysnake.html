By the second hit my mind is sucked<BR>
Inward, curling, folding<BR>
Water pipe<BR>
Put it down! Put it down!<BR>
Lights. Turn off. Switch. Where? Yes, flick.<BR>
Electricity on my skin<BR>
I roll back onto the mattress.<P>

The forest is dark.<BR>
A star, a mandala<BR>
Hovering above me, radiating, purple.<BR>
I can hold my breath forever<P>

From behind my head<BR>
Emerges a procession of beings made of light<BR>
The light-people<BR>
They walk in a row, beside me, looking down at me<BR>
as I lay on my back. Evaluating me.<BR>
Remember to breathe!<BR>
"Are they walking above me?" I hear myself whisper<P>

The procession walks on by me<BR>
The light-people disappear<BR>
Into the forest, into the dark<BR>
"May I come in?" I whisper.<BR>
They leave me, alone, in the darkness<BR>
I want in. I want deeper. I want more.<P>

I feel her hands as she picks me up<BR>
Holding me in her arms<BR>
Rocking me gently from side to side<BR>
I feel her, I know her<BR>
The giant mother, the queen, the goddess<BR>
I'm an infant, a new-born, a child of the sage<BR>
And she holds me in her arms<BR>
Comforting me, keeping me safe<BR>
When I'm ready she will show me, teach me<BR>
But not tonight<P>

Gently she puts me down<BR>
And when I open my eyes<BR>
I know that what happened<BR>
Is true<P><BR>
