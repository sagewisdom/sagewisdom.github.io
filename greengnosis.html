Under the stunted oak I waited for her<br>
the Green Lady<br>
clothed in the black of the mystified, the lost,<br>
but more truly, naked and unshriven, seeking a dying moment.<p>

Under my tongue, the bitter mint<br>
above my head, invisible leaves,<br>
known only for the moonlight they intercept<br>
below my back, the green grass that saw me through my youth.<p>

She came to me in a spirograph body<br>
wings twined with ivy in curliqued ringlets<br>
her fingers the thorns of roses pointed with the blood of the unworthy<br>
the edges of her smile reaching up to the stars, her teeth, barbed spikes<p>

I had not expected fear, but terror came with her<br>
and tho I sought a dying moment, she showed me a dying eternity<br>
and tho I sought to bring wisdom into the real, she tore the real from me<br>
and I was no more, and in unbeing, I lost my fear<p>

She made me into a mist, expanding slowly until I was all<br>
everywhere, blown by the wind of her breath<br>
into eddies and whorls within myself<br>
and it was I that her wings beat, to keep her aloft<p>

She flew in me, acrobatically spinning and turning<br>
casting off parts of myself in colors I have never seen<br>
I flowed across her wings, she breathed me<br>
and I flowed through her grasslike hair<p>

Soon, oh, too soon,<br>
boundries encircled me and I contracted, condensed<br>
and rained myself on the stunted oak, and dripped from it in rivulets<br>
and froze beneath it into this mortal body, clothed in black of the still<br>
mystified, but no longer lost.<p>
