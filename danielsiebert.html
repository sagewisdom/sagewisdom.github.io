<TD><FONT SIZE="+3">D</FONT>ANIEL SIEBERT is an independent researcher, pharmacognosist, ethnobotanist, educator, and author. He has been studying <I>Salvia divinorum</I> for over twenty years and was the first person to work on the human pharmacology of salvinorin A and to clearly identify this compound as the psychoactive principal of the plant. He has studied <I>Salvia divinorum</I> in its native habitat and has worked with it under the guidance of Mazatec shamans. His work appears in scientific journals and other publications. Mr. Siebert is the creator of the <A HREF="index.html"><I>Salvia divinorum Research and Information Center</I></A> web site. This was the first Internet resource to focus exclusively on information about <I>Salvia divinorum</I> and it continues to be the most comprehensive. He is also the founder and moderator of <I>Sagewise</I>, a closed-membership email-based discussion forum for <I>Salvia divinorum</I> researchers and professionals, and its predecessor, <i>Salvia,</i> which was the first on-line <I>Salvia divinorum</I> discussion forum. Daniel Siebert was featured in the 1998 television documentary “Sacred Weeds,” which aired on channel 4 in the United Kingdom. His comments and opinions on <i>Salvia divinorum</i> have appeared in USA Today, the New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and numerous daily newspapers in the United States, as well as in several other countries. Similarly, he has discussed the plant on CNN, Fox News, Telemundo International, the National Public Radio (NPR) program “All Things Considered," and many local television and radio stations. He currently resides in Malibu, California and is completing work on his comprehensive book about <I>Salvia divinorum,</I> <A HREF="divine.html"><I>Divine Sage</I></A>.</TD>

Ethnobotany, botany, horticulture, pharmacology, biology, chemistry, consciousness studies, philosophy, nature, art.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00">Current projects include:</FONT></B><A NAME="Section 1"><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Ethnobotanical research:</FONT></B> Expeditions to the Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca Mexico to study the role of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> in Mazatec culture, its traditional uses, and the beliefs, rituals, and mythology associated with it.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Pharmacology and consciousness studies:</FONT></B> Identifying and characterizing the range of effects produced by <I>Salvia divinorum</I>, through experiments, interviews, and the analysis of thousands of experiential reports. Exploring the tremendous potential of this herb as tool for understanding the nature of human consciousness.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Chemistry:</FONT></B> Identifing novel diterpenoids in <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> Locating sites of salvinorin production in the plant. Studying the metabolism of salvinorins in the human body. Developing semisynthetic salvinorin derivatives (colaboration).<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Collaboration and correspondence:</FONT></B> Sharing resources and knowledge. Bringing together the skills and expertise of scientists throughout the world to investigate such questions as: How does salvinorin A produce its effects? What is its receptor site affinity? Are there pharmacologically active isomers and analogs?<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Publication and documentation of important findings:</FONT></B> <a href="biblio.html">Scientific journals</a>, <a href="divine.html">books</a>, film, photography, <A HREF="index.html">my web site</A>, and <a href="biblio.html">magazines</a>.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Providing a mail order resource for <I>Salvia divinorum</I> and related materials: </FONT></B> <A HREF="salviashop.html"><I>The Sagewise Salvia Shop</I></A> offers <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves, standardized extracts, a unique sublingual extract, live cuttings of many rare clones, books, etc. <p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Botanical investigations and horticultural experimentation:</FONT></B> Looking for answers to several important questions, including:
<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI>Is <I>Salvia divinorum</I> native to the Sierra Mazateca or was it introduced from another area?
<LI>Does it exist in truly wild habitats, or are all non-cultivated populations feral?
<LI>Since it spreads almost exclusively through asexual propagation, how limited is its genetic diversity?
<LI>Are there other powerfully psychoactive <I>Salvia</I> species? 
</UL>
