Last night we tried salvia for the first time and found it quite a bewildering experience. After two or three tokes, the room began to swirl. I found myself in a boat on a river in the Amazon jungle. I could feel the wood of the side of the boat and feel the sun as real as the room had been a few moments before. I remember lying on the floor of the wooden boat, trying to sit up. After a short while, 3 mins, I realized that I had rolled off the bed and was lying next to the radiator, trying to pull myself upright. After this I felt stone cold sober, if a little strange. I was quite surprised by how I had felt when in the boat, as it felt so normal as to be hardly worthy of mention. It felt like I had done this a million times before, what was the fuss about?<BR>
