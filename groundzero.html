I felt pressure all around, as if I was under a hundred feet of water. Then, suddenly, I popped into ground-zero reality. The right side of my body opened up, and I connected down through the bed, through the floor and foundation of the house, into some immense planetary network, teaming with a multitude of various types of consciousness and intelligence. There was a definite sense of other beings around me. I noticed that I was a gravity well, sucking all sound and light around me into a vortex that had formed in the cusp of my curled body. I was channeling everything back into the nebulae that I had contacted. I was a receptor, and realized that we all are. We as humans are mere sense organs for the planet. My consciousness then flattened and spread, like dough under a rolling pin. It then began to separate into five distinct autonomous portions, each one a completely separate and full version of myself. I experienced them all simultaneously. At this point I kind of freaked out, not expecting such a drastic shift in perception. I thought, “This is way too much! I wasn’t expecting to dissolve and break apart like this!” I opened my eyes and sat up. Optic ballets of light and various shapes danced everywhere around my room, it was alive. I noticed that all matter is conscious. I could hear my heart beating. I got up and almost fell over, which surprised me, I didn’t realize it would have a physical effect as well. It seemed that I weighed 500 pounds and my arms were 12 feet long. I made it to the kitchen and got a drink of water. Then went and lay back down, and entered a trance for what seemed like 20 minutes.<P>

My consciousness and physical body began twisting and stretching like some bizarre silly putty being pulled though a cosmic taffy machine. I had visions of lives playing out, representing the whole of human experience: love, war, riot, and everything in between. I could clearly see my entire biological history, the chain of life. I had somehow accessed my genetic and cellular memory. All of my ancestors were present, then I realized that they always are, I just can’t always perceive them. I saw how potentiality becomes reality by force of will; that thought is matter. And I am dead serious when I say this. The actual physical world around us, meaning even the floor you are standing on, or the toilet you are pissing into, is created by a consensus of thought emanating from our multi-dimensional selves, vibrating at varying speeds, creating first the subatomic particles, which then combine and grow, and combine and grow, and on and on, until we have atoms, molecules, proteins, single-celled organisms, complex organisms, and finally the human and its large brain, which can re-access the cellular, molecular, and sub-atomic memories, commune with the just-out-of-perception logos, and realize its place in the continuum of existence that we ourselves created in the first place. When I “woke up” from this lucid dream-like state, I saw that about an hour had passed. The time compression was pronounced, and was very strange, it really only seemed that 20 minutes at most had passed. I was surprised that I felt nearly one hundred percent normal. It was an amazing and beautiful experience, despite the shock of it all.
