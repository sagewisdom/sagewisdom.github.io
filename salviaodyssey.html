<H1>Salvia Odyssey</H1>


<FONT SIZE="+1">
A small bitter ball of midnight-black wax,<br>
Smelling of tea, and time's passing,<br>
And fey sorcery.<p>

Lights out. I lie down in bed.<br>
It's like getting ready for sleep<br>
Yet beside me are a bowl and towel.<p>

I chew the wax.<br>
A little something<br>
Sparkles in the darkness.<p>

The wax is dissolving,<br>
The universe is fragmenting.<br>
Into green patterns.<p>

Fractal, complex.<br>
No joy. No fear.<br>
Observe.<p>

Become the still point.<br>
Lash myself to the mast<br>
Of stillness<p>

Immobility,<br>
Passivity.<br>
Consciousness persists.<p>

Remember.<br>
Hold breath to increase effect.<br>
And fractal lights bloom.<p>

Many people.<br>
Many places.<br>
My name is legion.<p>

Many times.<br>
A bar in Dublin, near the water.<br>
Ulysses? Joyce?<p>

No and Yes.<br>
A pioneer wagon<br>
crossing the icy Missouri.<p>

Become not one person.<br>
But a family amid<br>
Cold brown in-pouring waters.<p>

Dying consciousness falls<br>
Into an infolding green flower.<br>
Petals closing inwards.<p>

Falling into a black hole.<br>
Within whose event horizon<br>
Is neither death, nor time.<p>

Losing self who becomes the universe?<br>
Dying was nothing at all.<br>
Death is being everything.<p>

Something urgent.<br>
A need to spit. Spitting<br>
Wiping a mouth with a towel<p>

I feel a face pushing into a bowl.<br>
I feel a bowl pushing into a face.<br>
I have a face! A face!<p>

The Zen master asked<br>
What was your original face<br>
before you were conceived?<p>

Besaged laughter,<br>
the koan makes sense.<br>
All has always been.<p>
 
Awareness crystallizes,<br>
Out of a cooling magma,<br>
One crystal choosing to be me.<p>

I know my name.<br>
Jump out of bed.<br>
Freezing.<p>

Get into the hot tub,<br>
Soaking up heat.<br>
Soaking up life.<p>

Lazarus returning.<br>
Orpheus returning.<br>
Odysseus returning.<p>

Is that Argus barking?<br>
No! It's real.<br>
My dogs are barking.<p>

I give them dog biscuits.<br>
Trip's over.<br>
I'm back.<p>
