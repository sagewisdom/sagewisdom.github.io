In 1963, Carl Epling placed cuttings of Hofmann and Wasson's original type
collection of <i><i>S. divinorum</i></i> in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
Botanical Gardens.  Epling never saw these plants flower in the gardens at
UCLA, and mistakenly described them as having blue corollas.  The source of
this error is made apparent by Hofmann (1980), who recalls the time he and
Wasson received the plant material: 
<blockquote> 
<img src="images/oldwoman.jpg" height=210 width=150

      "From an old Curandera, a venerable woman in a strikingly
	    magnificent Mazatec garment, with the lovely name Natividad Rosa,
      we received a whole bundle of flowering specimens of the
      sought-after plant,... [she would not] tell us where she had
      gathered the leaves.  They grew in a very, very distant forest
      valley.  Wherever she dug up the plant, she put a coffee bean in
      the earth as thanks to the gods... We now possessed ample plants
      with flowers and roots, which were suitable for botanical
      identification... The plants had blue flowers crowned with a white
      dome..."</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In fact, the white dome referred to by Hofmann was the corolla, which, in
the specimen described, had apparently not yet opened.  Likewise, the
illustration of <i>S. divinorum</i> in Schultes and Hofmann (1980) includes only
flowers in bud, and the artist's rendition of the individual flower parts
emphasizes the mistake: the stamen, style, and corolla are each drawn as they
appear before the flower opens.  Hofmann and Wasson, neither of whom had any
idea what the flowers of this Salvia look like, did not realize what they
described as "blue flowers, crowned with a white dome" were actually blue
calyces with unopened white corollas.  The mistake survived in Epling and
J tiva's (1962) original description of the species because they never
themselves saw living flowers, and the white corollas turn brown upon drying. 
Diaz (1975), Emboden (1979), Valdes (1983), and Valdes et al. (1987) have all
correctly reported that the corollas of <i>S. divinorum</i> are pure white, while the
calyx and flowering stem are violet blue.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In the course of his pharmacological research, L.J. Valdes (1983) and
Valdes et al. (1987) performed several experiments designed to help answer
questions regarding the reproductive biology of <i>S. divinorum</i>.  Of the 14
flowers he cross-pollinated by hand, four set seed, though the number of
nutlets that reached maturity is unclear (the ovary of each flower consists of
four mericarps).  Valdes concluded that the species is self-sterile, though
apparently no attempt was made to self-pollinate any flowers.  Daylength
experiments, carried out in order to explain the blooming requirements of <i>S.
divinorum</i>, suggested that it is an obligate short-day plant, with plant height
a minor factor in flower initiation.  Still, the sporadic flowering of wild
populations, the conditions that promote flower initiation, and the failure of
the flowers to lead to fruit formation are aspects which remained unclear. 
These and other questions regarding coevolved pollinators and biological
status are addressed below.  Investigations of the author (Reisfield 1987)
described here have involved visiting and collecting material from many
populations in the field, a "stakeout" at a flowering population to observe
pollinators, chromosome number determination, greenhouse flower induction
experiments, artificial self- and cross-pollinations, pollen stainability
studies, fluorescence microscopy of pollen tube growth through styles, and
nectar analyses.
