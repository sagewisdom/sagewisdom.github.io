The Mazatecs of Central Mexico use this herb only with a clear intent and purpose. It is always used under the supervision of an experienced shaman. It is used this way for good reasons. Since Mazatec shamans are probably not available to guide you through your own <i>Salvia divinorum</i> experiments, it is essential that you thoroughly educate yourself before deciding to work with it. Talk to others who are already experienced with its effects, read books, and read the information available at the <I>Salvia divinorum</I> Research and Information Center.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>IMPORTANT!</B> I will not sell <I>Salvia divinorum</I> to minors! Do not place an order unless you are an adult over 18 years of age.

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Sierra Mazateca Prime Harvest</FONT></B><BR>
These leaves are about fifty-percent more potent than typical Hawaiian or Oaxacan leaves. They are sustainably harvested by Mazatecs farmers who cultivate the plants in their native region—the remote highlands of the <I>Sierra Mazateca</I> of Central Mexico. The Mazatec people have preserved <I>Salvia divinorum</I> and the knowledge surrounding its use for hundreds of years. We are privileged to have them share their sacred herb with us. This particular harvest contain a remarkable 0.4% salvinorin A. This is exceptional in that it represents some of the most potent leaves I have ever come across. Very highly recommended!<P>

<FONT SIZE="5">S</FONT>AGE GODDESS EMERALD ESSENCE is an extraordinary potion of enchantment. One of the finest <I>Salvia divinorum</I> preparations ever created, it engenders profound experiences that enrich and nurture mind and spirit. As a tool for exploring the psyche it can provide access to fresh, often startling, insights into the nature of consciousness, reality, perception, and the fundamental mysteries of existence.<p>

A Sage Wisdom Botanicals exclusive. This ultra-concentrated tincture of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> has been carefully prepared using a unique new separation process developed by Daniel Siebert. This innovative process selectively extracts and concentrates a group of natural leaf components that enhance the solubility and absorption of the active principal, salvinorin A. All intermediary extraction solvents have been completely removed so that the finished product contains nothing but premium grade <I>Salvia divinorum</I>, grain alcohol and water.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
 
This specially prepared extract is designed for sublingual absorption. The duration and quality of the experience is equivalent to that obtained using traditional Mazatec methods of oral ingestion, but it is far easier to consume and the level of effects achieved is more consistent and reliable. Many people consider this type of experience more productive and rewarding than that of smoked <I>Salvia divinorum</I> because the effects are gentler and considerably longer lasting.<p>

The first effects begin 4–8 minutes after the initial dose is ingested. The strength of the effects gradually increase over the next 4–5 minutes, reaching a plateau that lasts 20–30 minutes, then gradually tapering off over another 1½–2½ hours. By using multiple doses, the duration of both the plateau and the entire experience can be increased. If the effects begin to diminish sooner than you would like, you can use booster doses to extend the experience.<p>
 
Mild doses reduce extraneous mental activity and calm the mind; many people find that low doses are quite valuable as an aid to meditation and introspection. Mild doses also increase sensual awareness and can have aphrodisiac effects. A moderate dose produces a gentle expansion of consciousness that is useful for inner-journeying and self-exploration; this can also have an extraordinary memory enhancing effect that can provide access to incredibly detailed memories stretching back into early childhood (clearly this has therapeutic potential). Strong doses alter the fabric of consciousness profoundly, producing rich inner-visions and inspiring insight. Very strong doses can totally immerse one in a visionary world and can propel consciousness into the far reaches of transdimensional/transpersonal space.<p>

</p><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#99FF00"><B>Standardized Salvinorin A Enhanced Leaf<br>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="5">M</FONT>ANY PEOPLE enjoy the effects of smoked <I>Salvia divinorum</I>. However, it can be difficult to achieve a satisfactory level of effects from the leaf in its natural state because of the large quantities of smoke that must be inhaled. Salvinorin A enhanced leaves make it possible to achieve effects much more easily because far less smoke is involved.<P>
 
The products below are prepared by extracting pure salvinorin A, then adding a measured quantity back onto <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves to bring them up to a specific, reliable, and consistent level of potency. Products that have been prepared in this manner have particularly good burning characteristics because they do not contain the gummy impurities found in crude extracts (such as '5x' and '10x'). Since the impurities have been removed during the extraction process, they won't end up in your lungs.<p>

This is standardized to contain exactly 1 mg salvinorin A per 25 mg of leaf (this is equivalent to 40 mg salvinorin A per gram of leaf). Because of its strength, it should only be used if the individual doses have been accurately weighed. Most people do not have access to the type of
precision balance necessary for doing this; therefore, I only offer this in individually
packaged, pre-weighed, 25-mg units. This only produces a tiny wisp of smoke, so it is ideal for people who want to minimize smoke ingestion as much as possible. Each 25-mg unit is packaged in a gelatine capsule (this serves as a container only, and is not meant to imply oral consumption). Each unit is sufficient for 1-2 uses for a person of average sensitivity.<p>

This specially prepared extract of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> has been designed for sublingual ingestion. The duration and quality of the experience is equivalent to chewing fresh leaves using the quid method, but it is far less difficult to consume and the level of effects obtained is more consistent and reliable. Each bolus contains approximately 40 mg salvinorin A; however, only a small percentage of this is actually absorbed. Absorption takes place gradually, in time-release fashion, producing an extended experience which typically lasts 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 hours. Many people consider this type of experience to be far more productive and rewarding than the short duration effects obtained by smoking. Each bolus of extract is sufficient for one moderately strong experience; however, it can be divided into two doses that will each produce a mild level of effects.

      <td width="77%"><font color="#ECE8C4"><FONT SIZE="5">K</FONT>ratom is one of the most effective and pleasurable psychoactive herbs available. It is usually taken as a tea. Alternatively, the leaves can be chewed or powdered and swallowed. Most people use a dose between 2 and 25 grams, depending on the level of effects desired. The effects last for 4 to 6 hours. When large doses are taken, some residual effects may linger for several hours longer. At low doses it induces mild euphoria and reduces fatigue. Low doses do not interfere with most ordinary activities, however, one should not drive or perform other activities that require full attention. At strong doses (16-25 grams) the effects are profoundly euphoric and immensely pleasurable. Typically people describe the effects as dreamy, ecstatic, and blissful. Many people experience closed-eye visuals. Strong doses must only be used when one can devote several hours to the experience itself. This herb is extremely rare outside of its native region in Southeast Asia. Kratom is illegal in Australia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand. A recent analytical study found that most of the "kratom" sold in the USA and Europe was misrepresented and is not the correct plant. Chemical analysis has confirmed that our leaves are authentic kratom. We feel fortunate to have been able to obtain a supply of the real thing to share with our customers. We are confident that this will appeal to many people who are also interested in <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> Highly recommended.</font> For more information about kratom, plaese read <a href="kratomguide.html">The Kratom User's Guide.</a><P>

      <td width="77%"><font color="#ECE8C4"><FONT SIZE="5">A</FONT>fter many years of searching, we have finally been able to obtain a supply of this extremely rare herb. <i>Lagochilus inebrians</i> has long been used for its intoxicating properties by Tajik, Tartar, Turkoman, and Uzbek tribesman. The species name inebrians refers to its traditional use as an inebriant. It is traditionally taken as a tea. The tea is usually sweetened with honey or sugar to make it more palatable. Alternatively, it can be steeped in alcohol to make a tincture (vodka works fine for this). Less herb is needed per dose when it is taken as a tincture because alcohol is more effective than water at extracting the active constituents. Depending on the method of preparation used and strength of effects desired, dosages may range from approximately 3 to 30 grams.<P>

The effects of the plant have been largely attributed to the diterpene lagochilin. The closely related compounds lagochilin-3-acetate and lagochilin-tetraacetate are also present in the plant and might contribute to the overall effects. Like <i>Salvia divinorum,</i> this is one of the few members of the mint family (Labiatae) that is traditionally used as an inebriant. The most commonly reported effects include relaxation, euphoria, and subtle perceptual changes.<p>

Some vendors are selling herbs as "<i>Lagochilus inebrians</i>" that are not the correct species. At least one vendor has been selling a different species, <i>Lagochilus cabulicus,</i> falsely claiming that it is the same as <i>Lagochilus inebrians.</i> I have analyzed the material offered by that vendor and found that it does not contain lagochilin. Unfortunately, the problem of people selling misidentified herbs is quite common. Unlike most other vendors, we always compare the morphological and chemical characteristics of our herbs against authenticated specimens to make sure that they are what they are supposed to be.

<FONT SIZE="5">W</FONT>HITE SAGE smudge bundles have long been used as an important ceremonial incense by many Native American peoples for ritual purification and cleansing. The smoke smells wonderful and has a soothing, calming effect. I like to use it when working with <I>Salvia divinorum</I> in much the same way as the Mazatecs use copal incense. The end of the bundle should be set alight, then allowed to smolder. The smoke is then wafted around the room and over the body. <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves can be ritually cleansed by passing them over the smoke before they are ingested. The smoke can also be used to define 'sacred space' - a clearly defined area for the session to take place in. I find that this practice creates a calm, mindful focus and sense of preparedness that helps to prepare one for the journey ahead.<!-- Freshly harvested seeds are also available for those who would like to try their hand at growing their own white sage plants.--><p>

A few pieces of copal are placed on top of chunks of hot charcoal. The heat of the charcoal causes the resin to melt, then vaporize, creating an extraordinarily fragrant, powerful, rich, and enchanting smoke that is used for ritual purification and cleansing.

<P>

This is the long-awaited English language version of Dr. Rätsch's massive encyclopedia. The most comprehensive and thoroughly illustrated guide to the botany, history, distribution, and cultivation of all known psychoactive plants. The photos in this book are amazing. Essential reading (and viewing) for anyone with a deep interest in the subject.<P>

• Examines 414 psychoactive plants and related substances.<P>

• Hardcover. 944 pages. Contains 800 color photographs and 670 black-and-white illustrations.<P>

In the traditions of every culture, plants have been highly valued for their nourishing, healing, and transformative properties. Many of the most powerful plants—those known to transport the human mind into other dimensions of consciousness—have traditionally been regarded as sacred. In <i>The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants</i> Christian Rätsch details the botany, history, distribution, cultivation, and preparation and dosage of more than 400 psychoactive plants. He discusses their ritual and medicinal usage, cultural artifacts made from these plants, and works of art that either represent or have been inspired by them. The author begins with 168 of the most well-known psychoactives—such as cannabis, datura, and papaver—then presents 133 lesser known substances (including <i>Salvia divinorum</i>) as well as additional plants known as “legal highs,” plants known only from mythological contexts and literature, and plant products that include substances such as <i>ayahuasca,</i> incense, and soma. The text is lavishly illustrated with 800 color photographs—many of which are from the author’s extensive fieldwork around the world—showing the people, ceremonies, and art related to the ritual use of the world’s sacred psychoactives. Although this book may seem a bit expensive, it is actually quite reasonably priced considering its size and the number of photographs that it contains.

With repeated sessions using salvia over the course of several years, J. D. Arthur began returning each time to the same inner landscape where he found himself entering a unique state of "thought-free” awareness. There he accessed a mode of “dream language” that communicated an exquisite constellation of detailed meanings swiftly and flawlessly. His repeated immersion in these states of trance, as well as his analysis of their approach and withdrawal, led to a profound reassessment of the nature of normal perception and a reevaluation of what we refer to as the real world. With true-life descriptions of salvia-induced visionary states, this book offers a detailed experiential analysis for those interested in exploring salvia in their quest for higher knowledge.<p>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00" >"This author's thoughtful investigation of the unique, leaf-induced state merits careful attention. His methodical approach and detailed documentation is a model of how to meaningfully explore such vast and elusive topics as time, mind, and language. His careful forays led him to establish familiar pathways both into and out of what he suggests may be another reality, or the far side of death. Mr. Arthur's conclusions beg the very question: What is thought?"<BR>

This book is an excellent guide to the ritual use of vision-inducing substances as tools for cultivating practical spirituality. Although it focuses on the use of mushrooms, most of the information is equally applicable to <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> In this book the author uses the term <i>spiritual</i> in a very broad sense, and he avoids getting bogged down in religious, theistic, ethnocentric, or New Age interpretations of what that might mean. We strongly recommend this book to all salvia users, especially those who wish to utilze this herb for spiritual purposes.<p>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00" >"A visual, spiritual, and intellectual feast, Plants of the Gods is the best book ever written on hallucinogenic plants."<BR>
--Dr. Mark Plotkin, Conservation International, author of Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets<P>

"This is a greatly enlarged and expanded edition. The photographs are spectacular. A chapter on <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is included. This book is well-worth purchasing, even if you already own previous editions." --Daniel J. Siebert<P></FONT>

Three scientific titans join forces to completely revise the classic text on the ritual uses of psychoactive plants. They provide a fascinating testimony of these "plants of the gods;" tracing their uses throughout the world and their significance in shaping culture and history. In the traditions of every culture, plants have been highly valued for their nourishing, healing, and transformative properties. The most powerful of these plants, which are known to transport the human mind into other dimensions of consciousness, have always been regarded as sacred. The authors detail the uses of hallucinogens in sacred shamanic rites while providing lucid explanations of the biochemistry of these plants and the cultural prayers, songs, and dances associated with them. The text is lavishly illustrated with 400 rare photographs of plants, people, ceremonies, and art related to the ritual use of the world's sacred psychoactive flora.</font>

<FONT SIZE="5" >D</FONT>ESIGNED by visionary artist Alex Grey as an aid for internal visualizations and inner journeys. The Mindfold Relaxation Mask consists of a flexible black face piece backed with high-density soft foam padding. The foam padding has cutouts that allow you to experience <i>total</i> darkness with your eyes open! An adjustable head strap allows you to fit the Mindfold mask snuggly and comfortably to your face. It is a simple design that works extraordinarily well.<P>

This is a great tool for visionary journeys in general, but especially so for use with <i>Salvia divinorum,</i> because its effects are much more pronounced when one is in darkness. Also useful for meditation, relaxation, sleep, and headache relief. A set of earplugs is included.<P>

<I>Salvia divinorum</I> seeds are extremely rare. For reasons that are not well understood, the plants almost never produce seed, and even when they do, the majority of the seeds are not viable and therefore fail to germinate. Because of this, I do not sell seed. Fortunately, the plant is easily propagated from cuttings. In the interest of increasing the genetic diversity of the <I>Salvia divinorum</I> plants in cultivation, I am making available all of the rare clones that I maintain in my own collection. Most of these clones are not available anywhere else.<p>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Note: Due to the harsh environment at their present location, my <I>Salvia divinorum</I> plants are not growing well; therefore, I am not currently able to offer cuttings. I plan to relocate the plants to a more hospitable environment in the future and at that time I will resume shipping cuttings.</B></FONT><P>

For more information about any of these clones go to: <A HREF="clones.html">http://sagewisdom.org/clones.html</A><p>

All plants are shipped as cuttings. Cuttings can be shipped year-round, but are most easily propagated when the plants are actively growing. The cuttings are first wrapped in misted paper towels, then placed inside inflated self-sealing bags. They can survive for several days when packed this way. Rooting the cuttings is your responsibility. I can make no guarantee of success. <I>Salvia divinorum</I> is quite easy to grow from cuttings. However, <U>you should only order cuttings from me if you feel reasonably confidant of your ability to root this plant</U>. I ship healthy cuttings that <U>will</U> root and grow if cared for properly. Rooting and growing instructions are available on-line at: <A HREF="salvgrow.html">http://sagewisdom.org/salvgrow.html</A> and also at: <A HREF="faq.html">http://sagewisdom.org/faq.html</A>. Most clones of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> are almost impossible to tell apart, so if you plan on growing more than one, please label the plants well.<p><br>

        fortunate to be able to make these extremely rare seeds available to
        you. For reasons that are not well understood, <I>Salvia divinorum</I> 
        plants almost never set seed.<!-- Botanists have never found seeds on plants
        growing in their indigenous habitat, and I know of only four instances
        in which they have been found on cultivated plants. The seeds we are
        offering were obtained from a <I>Salvia divinorum</I>  farmer in Hawaii
        who was willing to part with some of his precious crop.--> The seeds
        germinate in approximately fourteen days, and the germination rate is
        typically about thirty percent.<!-- Almost all <I>Salvia divinorum</I> 
        plants in circulation have been propagated from cuttings derived from
        only two clones, thus genetic diversity has been extremely limited.--> When
        you start new plants from seed you are establishing new, genetically
        unique individuals, and thus doing important work to help expand the
        genetic diversity of this rare species. Please be careful to label your
        seed-raised plants so that they do not get confused with other <I>Salvia divinorum</I> 
        plants in your collection. Most <I>Salvia divinorum</I>  plants are
        indistinguishable from each other, but occasionally a seed-raised plant
        will be visibly distinctive in some way. If you do obtain an unusual
        plant, please contact us. For advice on raising <i>Salvia divinorum</i> plants

  All inquiries and orders will be responded to promptly and professionally. Unless otherwise noted, all items are in stock and ready for immediate shipping upon receipt of payment. Most orders are shipped within 24 hours. During unusually busy periods, shipping may be delayed an additional day or two, and I do not normally ship on weekends.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Delivery Options:</B></FONT><br>

<B>Express Mail:</B> delivers overnight to most addresses in the USA. It takes two days to reach some areas.

<!--This option is temporarily not available. We will be offering Express Mail service again begining March 28th. In the mean time, please select Priority Mail if you are in the United States, or Air Mail if you are outside of the United States.--><P>

<B>Priority Mail:</B> typically delivers in 2–3 days throughout the USA (if you are in the Los Angeles area, the package usually gets delivered the day after we ship it.)</font><P>

<B>Regular First Class Mail:</B> The farther your address is from mine (Malibu, California), the longer it will take to reach you. Allow about a week if you are on the East-coast.<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>IMPORTANT:</B></FONT> The transit periods shown above only apply <I>after</I> the package has been shipped. Also, bear in mind that the postal service does not always deliver packages on time; sometimes packages are delayed. If your package does not arrive as soon as you expect, please be patient—it is probably in transit.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Shipping Charges:</B></FONT><br> 
The shipping charge is automatically calculated based on the weight of the order and the shipping method chosen. A $5.00 basic processing/handling fee is included in the shipping charge.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Packaging:</B></FONT><br> 
Because some people worry about such things, all orders are packaged inconspicuously. The shipping label shows your name and address, and my return address. That is all.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Domestic Shipping (within the United States):</B></FONT><br> 
<font color="#ECE8C4"> 
We ship everywhere in the United States. But before you finalize your order, please be aware of the following:
<UL TYPE="CLOSEDCIRCLE">

<LI><em>Salvia divinorum</em> is classified as a controlled substance in the states of Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Virginia. If you live in one of these states, you would be taking a legal risk bringing this herb into your state.
<LI><em>Salvia divinorum</em> is also illegal in the states of Louisiana and Tennessee, but only if intended for human consumption. Therefore, residents of Louisiana and Tennessee should only purchase this herb if they will be using it for some other purpose. Such uses include growing the plant for ornamental purposes and any kind of scientific research that does not involve administering the drug to human subjects. A local law prohibits possession of <em>Salvia divinorum</em> in Suffolk County, New York.
<LI><em>Salvia divinorum</em> is entirely legal in all other states.</font>

<UL TYPE="CLOSEDCIRCLE">

<LI>We cannot ship <i>Salvia divinorum</i> to Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, South Korea, or Sweden because it is a controlled substance in those countries and packages are likely to be intercepted by Customs officials.

If you need a package shipped by International Express Mail, please email me with a list of the items you want to order together with your shipping address. I will then calculate the International Express Mail charge for your order and reply to you by email.<P>-->

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Return Policy:</B></FONT><br>
I will only accept returns in situations where the wrong item was shipped. People vary a lot in sensitivity to <I>Salvia divinorum.</I> Some people are extremely sensitive, and others are amazingly resistant to its effects. Somewhere between 10%-15% of people are unusually insensitive to salvia; these people are often referred to as "salvia hardheads." Although most people can obtain effects from salvia, not all people enjoy its effects. The products I offer are of excellent quality. All extracts are prepared very carefully and their salvinorin A content is consistent. If you have difficulty obtaining effects, you are either not using the product properly or you are a salvia hardhead. I cannot accept returns or offer refunds in cases where a person has low sensitivity to salvia or does not like its effects. Salvia pleases most of the people most of the time, but certainly not all of the people all of the time.<P>
