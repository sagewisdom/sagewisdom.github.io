of 1983-84, at no time was a legitimate pollinator observed visiting flowers. 
While poor flight conditions for Hymenoptera often prevailed, pollinators were
also conspicuously absent during an entire, sunny, hot afternoon while flowers
were collected near Cerro Quemado.  Bumblebees were active in the area, but
they ignored the white and violet inflorescences of <i>S. divinorum</i> as they do
scarlet flowers of many ornithophilous salvias.  The explanation for this
behavior is suggested by the dimensions of the <i>S. divinorum</i> corolla, which
more resembles those of ornithophilous <i>Salvia</i>s than melittophilous ones (Fig.
3).  The sigmoid corolla tube is 19-22 mm long, and measures only 2 by 1.5 mm
at its narrowest point, near the throat.  The lower lip, which is horizontally
expanded to form a landing platform on bee flowers, is instead vertically
oriented, with the middle lobe somewhat cupped, like those of classical
hummingbird pollinated <i>Salvia</i>s.  The sigmoid curvature of the corolla tube is
uncommon in bee flowers, but characterizes several bird pollinated species of
<i>Salvia</i>, such as those in sect. <i>Flexuosae</i> Epling.

   Data obtained from analyzing nectar constituents are consistent with
ornithophily.   As might be expected, the nectar sugar is sucrose dominant, as
are most nectars from flowers pollinated by long-tongued bees, hawkmoths, or
birds.  Flowers from clonotypic plants yielded a nectar sugar composed of 86%
sucrose, 10% fructose, and 4% glucose.  This evidence is even less meaningful
in light of the fact that the Labiatae, as a group, are characterized by
sucrose-rich or sucrose-dominant nectar sugars (Baker & Baker 1983).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   While the corolla tube of <i>S. divinorum</i> suggests a co-evolved pollinator
with long mouthparts, information concerning nectar sugar concentration and
the volume of nectar secreted can help resolve further the identity of this
long-tongued pollinator.  Nectars sampled by Cruden et al. (1981) from a
spectrum of Mexican plants below 2400 m showed that bee flowers produce more
concentrated nectars (34.7%) than hawkmoth- (22.6%) and bird-pollinated
(23.8%) flowers.  The concentration of nectar sugar produced by
greenhouse-grown plants of <i>S. divinorum</i> was mostly between 21% and 23%.  In
general, hummingbird flowers have low nectar-sugar concentrations, but produce
larger total quantities of nectar than bee flowers.  Because of the interplay
between pollinator adaptation, on the one hand, and the constraints of
phylogenetic relationship, on the other (Baker & Baker 1983), data presented
by Cruden et al. (1981) from several species of <i>Salvia</i> are especially useful
for comparison with data obtained from <i>S. divinorum</i>.  Ornithophilous species
of <i>Salvia</i> sampled by Cruden et al. included <i>S. cardinalis</i> (17.71 Êl per
flower), <i>S. elegans</i> (7.52 Êl), <i>S. greggi</i> (3.49 Êl), and <i>S. pubescens</i>
 (20.72
Êl).  Melittophilous species sampled included <i>S. tiliaefolia</i> (.015 Êl per
flower), <i>S. reflexa</i> (.14 Êl), and <i>S. cohuilensis</i> (.53 Êl).  Despite the fact
that nectar accumulation data obtained by intermittently sampling flowers of
<i>S. divinorum</i> grown in the greenhouse are plagued with inconsistencies, there
is no question that the quantity of nectar produced suggests ornithophily,
with measurements ranging from 8-16 Êl, most flowers producing a total
quantity of nectar near 9 Êl.  Still, several questions emerged, such as the
possible negative effect of the intrusive sampling technique, the effect of
nectar removal on secretion rates, and the effect of the time of secretion on
the quantity of nectar produced, since flowering and nectar production were
asynchronous.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   No nocturnal visitors were observed during the overnight stakeout near
flowering populations of <i>S. divinorum</i> at Cerro Quemado.  Flowers opened
asynchronously in the evening or during the night, and nectar production was
also initiated asynchronously, mostly during the night.  Virtually 3 of every
4 flowers had a hole punctured in the calyx and corolla tube, presumably by
nectar robbers, and even many unopened flowers containing little or no nectar
were pierced.  At the first signs of dawn, under an overcast sky, a single,
large hummingbird with a conspicuously decurved bill visited virtually every
flower, flitting from flower to flower in an irregular fashion.  It flew away
in the direction of additional flowering stands of <i>S. divinorum</i>, and several
minutes later returned and again visited most flowers.  The nectar in most of
the flowers was depleted by the bird, and pollen grains had been deposited on
several stigmas.  Two bumblebees were in the area but ignored the <i>Salvia</i>
flowers.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The observations described can in no way be considered evidence for the
co-evolution between <i>S. divinorum</i> and a species of hummingbird, especially in
light of the many supposed melittophilous salvias that are visited by these
opportunistic birds (Reisfield 1987).  Still, dimensions of the corolla,
nectar constituents, and the amount of nectar produced per flower, all suggest
the ornithophilous syndrome.  On the other hand, anthropogenic distribution,
white corolla color, sporadic and infrequent flowering of populations during
most of the year, the great amount of nectar robbing, and apparent complete
lack of fruit set, suggest the relationship between plant and pollinator has
not been "fine-tuned" by natural selection.
