Last night I diluted 4 large dropper's of Emerald Essence
with hot water, using more  water than Daniel's instructions
recommend (about twice as much). I find that using more
water eliminates the irritation without noticeably weakening
the effect.<p>

After putting the diluted essence into my mouth, I turned
off the lights and got into bed (the safest place to park my
body when I will be traveling without it). The effects came
on quickly. I passed through level three without seeing very
many closed eye visuals but then abruptly found myself in
some town in Mexico staring at 'two brothers' (I was sure
they were brothers although not twins). They both were
wearing sombreros.<p>

The next thing I knew was that I had a 'karmic link' to both
brothers at once.  But then, when I rationally questioned
that I could be somehow linked to two Mexican brothers whom
I did not know, to my utter astonishment (Salvia definitely
has a weird sense of humor) I became their sombreros!<p>

Around this time in consensus reality I swallowed the
Essence I had been holding in my mouth.<p>

Then Mexico vanished and I was alone in space. My
consciousness diffused through all space and time and I
'became the universe'. The thought came  - it seemed like a
message - 'that I always had been the entire universe', just
as everyone else always was the entire universe.
Individuality was revealed as just a limitation of
viewpoint, albeit one necessary for biological survival. I
saw that every individual 'really' extends throughout all
space-time, and that what was 'me' depended on where 'I'
chose to draw the boundaries - at my skin, at the limit of
my memories, at the boundaries of my social web, at the
history of my culture, at all humanity, at the whole history
of planet Earth or wherever I chose.<p>

The message came - as a thought  or feeling not as a voice -
that what I really was ultimately, what any individual was,
was the freedom to choose the boundaries - or not to. That I
WAS FREEDOM, the freedom to define myself.<p>

At this point I realized the trip was starting to wane. I
was startled to hear 'cosmic' laughter and repeated
exclamations of Holy Shit! It was my voice. The sounds were
coming from my mouth. I realized I had a mouth, that I had a
body. And then, abruptly, I was back in consensus reality.<p>

This morning I went about my life, but would from time to
time, find myself looking at the world a bit quizzically and
thinking 'Holy Shit!', as I smiled bemusedly at the
strangeness of it all.
