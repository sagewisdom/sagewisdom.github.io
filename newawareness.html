The Setting: A deserted beach in southern Mississippi on a bright, windy
day.&nbsp; I was with my friend (lets call him M).&nbsp; He would be my sitter.<br>
<br>
The Experience:
<!--I sat down in a comfortable position with my head
propped up and my hands folded.&nbsp; M filled the pipe (a cheap cannabis
pipe) to the brim with Salvia. I found myself a bit nervous...the same
feeling one would feel before a carnival ride he/she has never been on.
M then lit the pipe and administered the first hit to me.&nbsp; I held it in for a good 20 seconds. Nothing much of a cannabis buzz happened for the first three hits.&nbsp; I signaled for a 4th hit.&nbsp; I held that in for a while, and then laid my head back.&nbsp; All of a sudden I fell into an
amnesic dream.&nbsp; I was thinking to myself...that&#39;s weird nothing
happened.&nbsp; That&#39;s it?&nbsp; That&#39;s what salvia is like?&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel a thing!&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; I&#39;m dreaming, but I&#39;m not asleep!&nbsp; Here&#39;s how I described it to a friend:<br>
<br>
&quot;Imagine you are on this futuristic roller coaster right before it takes off.&nbsp; You hear a voice that says &quot;Get Ready...you are about to be catapulted off into the ride of your life&quot; and then BANG...you have no idea what just happened.&nbsp; You seemed to have dozed off right after the bang, but you&#39;re not sleeping.&nbsp; You then think to yourself am I in an amusement park?&nbsp; Wait, I went on the roller coaster and I heard this voice tell me I am about to be catapulted into the ride of my life, or something.&nbsp; I don&#39;t remember anything after hearing that voice.&nbsp; Is THIS
it???&nbsp; It can&#39;t be...it seems so...familiar.&nbsp; Normal.&nbsp; I&#39;ve done this a
thousand times before I was old enough to retain memories.&nbsp; Wait...is
that...I&#39;m sleeping...who is that...this is so simple...I understand
perfectly...things are always the same...&quot;.<br>
<br>
After smoking Salvia, I felt some sort of amnesia. I was not quite sure
what happened after the 3rd or 4th hit.&nbsp; I then realized
something...this WAS the trip.&nbsp; It was like I fell asleep for 10 years
after the 3rd hit, then right before I woke up, time traveled back 10
years and I woke up immediately after taking that hit.<br>
<br>During the moments after I felt like I had done this a hundred times
before.&nbsp; -->
I felt like I was in a scene from my childhood, almost as if I
had smoked salvia as a child and was feeling something in the present.
I felt (note, I didn&#39;t see any of this, it was purely a feeling) like I
was eight years old, in a park around my house in a swing during the middle
of a summer day.&nbsp; After I got this feeling, the feeling of the park
transformed into where I was: the beach at present age.&nbsp; I then began
to see (through closed eyelids) what looked like a ranch in Mexico.&nbsp; I
then "felt" that I was in the desert southwest, looking into this
ranch.&nbsp; Through closed eyelids, I saw the beach I was on, but then a few
yards away, the beach sand ended and the ranch/desert began.&nbsp; In the
ranch, I thought I saw a beautiful Mexican lady<!--, but I could be wrong-->.
I then felt I was on an Indian reservation, with some Indians.&nbsp; I felt
the feeling of the <i>peyoteros.</i> I then felt the
ranch/desert/reservation drift away, not in a normal fashion, but around
my body in a 360 degree turn around my body.&nbsp; I felt a closeness
with the aura of it all. I then felt
&quot;normal&quot; again and lied there still for a few moments, with my eyes
closed.&nbsp; M had wondered off and I heard him in the distance. I then
heard footsteps come behind the umbrellas, and then around them.&nbsp; I felt
the presence of some old, yet beautiful man (could have been a woman)
sprinkle some dust on me.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t feel the dust, but I felt something
mentally.&nbsp; I then opened my eyes. I felt exactly like what happened to Jodie Foster in the movie <i>Contact,</i> as she crashed onto the beach after being transported in that machine.&nbsp; Also, the scene afterward where she comes back to earth, yet still feeling she was on that beach.<br>
<br>
I sat up and walked off to the edge of the beach.&nbsp; I was left with a
sort of knowingness.&nbsp; I realized many things at this point<!-- after the
experience-->.&nbsp; I would call <i>this</i> the best part of the experience.&nbsp;<!-- The theories
I had come up with the days before seemed to make sense.&nbsp; <i>Everything</i>
seemed to make total sense.&nbsp; I thought about the world I live in.&nbsp; That
didn&#39;t make sense. Commercialism, money, business, finance,
government, that made no sense.&nbsp; I realized that things such as fear
(such of that of ghosts), jealousy, anxiety, stress, fright, these were
things that are human.&nbsp; These things are built into the human mind to
act as hurdles that we must jump.&nbsp; She said that things such as
fundamentalist religion and science were parts of this &quot;human&quot; quality.
None of these &quot;human&quot; things made sense.&nbsp; I realized that in the
afterworld (or whatever), these things are no longer present. The human
brain acts as a filter for our soul.&nbsp; We can not directly experience the
things our soul feels, so it gets filtered through our brain.&nbsp; This
filter adds things such as fear and hate to the things that our soul
feels.&nbsp; I felt like that filter had been removed for a while. This could
technically be called losing your mind, though it had nothing to do with
sanity.&nbsp; I repeated to myself &quot;If only they knew&quot;.&nbsp; I had the feeling of
having gone to heaven.&nbsp; I was also shown the goodness of psychedelic
drugs.&nbsp; She told me that she had many, many &quot;friends&quot;...many of them
haven&#39;t been discovered yet.&nbsp; I walked back to the umbrellas to M.&nbsp; He
asked me how it was.&nbsp; I just sat there silent, meditative.&nbsp; I told him
&quot;I can&#39;t tell you what this is&quot;.&nbsp; I had no sense of shock.&nbsp; I had no
sense of WOW, no sense of surprise.&nbsp; It was just a sense of knowingness,
understanding, calmness, peace.&nbsp; I remained silent for the whole
&quot;afterglow&quot; period.&nbsp; Now, I look at things a different way.&nbsp;--> Salvia is
definitely a &quot;teacher&quot; plant.&nbsp; I now look upon her very seriously and with the utmost respect.<P>
