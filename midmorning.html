The weary couch again accepts<BR>

a body's torpid plop.<BR>

Contours sigh in resignation,<BR>

yielding to the tired rite;<BR>

its cushion long past pressed<BR>

into a sunken mass.<P>



Slumber swiftly, surely ensues,<BR>

granting sentience craven respite.<P>


***********<BR>

"Depression is illusion."<BR>

A subtle voice infusion<BR>

disturbs the vacant sleeper's inert realm.<BR>

"You've squelched your vital Spirit's elf,<BR>

ignoring every holy prompt;<BR>

by hiding you deny Her life.<BR>

She's languid, dying, hear me:<BR>

Life lives only in Love.  She's crying, 'Do not fear me!'"<BR>

The voice grows vigorous,<BR>

commanding spellbound audience.<P>



Our startled dreamer harkens, heeds -<BR>

he hears a shaman sowing seeds.<BR>

"Sacred Mint balm revives.<BR>

Dead love transmutes through Her.<BR>

You must eat Her essence live,<BR>

verdant where you woo Her.<P>



"Chew Her under your tongue.<BR>

Do not think about it.<BR>

Absorb emerald awe.<BR>

It voids every thoughtstream.<BR>

Feel fresh force quickly spark<BR>

each cell's viscous liquid.<BR>

Gravity dissipates,<BR>

But you're left in her leaves.<P>



"Apt osmosis is Her prayer.<BR>

Open wide where you're aware.<BR>

Breathe in Spirit light <IMG width=30 SRC=dot_clea.gif>   like air."<P>



***********<BR>

Nervous system juices jolt electric,<BR>

propelling their ecstatic host<BR>

from his false death bed nightmare.<BR>

Body portals pulsate, fling wide open,<BR>

voicing joyful elegy to<BR>

gasp of ego straining to contain<BR>

the eager energy expulsion<BR>

sure to surge beyond its system's limit.<P>



Frenzied atoms whirl in fevered orbit;<BR>

separate entities, nevertheless<BR>

choired urgent union chanting,<BR>

silent burning and incanting,<BR>

supplicating an ensured release from body's bounds.<P>



The throng is loosed in pure angelic blast -<BR>

searing with vitalities that shatter mortal cast,<BR>

roaring now awaring how minutest thought redounds<BR>

on every subtle speck in this vibrant universe.<BR>

They stream until they still where future passed,<BR>

planting possibility in vast akashic grounds.<BR>

Green seedlings germinate in them, sprouting viny verse.
