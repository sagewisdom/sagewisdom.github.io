An anagram is a word, or phrase, constructed by rearranging
all the letters in another word or phrase. There are
websites that will transform any word or phrase into
anagrams. Wasting time, I went to one such site and put in
the phrase "Salvia divinorum," and was surprised when I got
what seemed to be thousands of anagrams.<p>

Some of the more interesting ones sound to me like demented
fortune cookies, others like Zen poetry that one almost (but
never quite) "gets." Yet others make perfect sense in an
oracular way. You be the judge which.<p>

I've strung some of them together into a "nonsense" poem. 
Each line of the poem is an anagram on the words "Salvia
divinorum." Imagine it as the voice of Salvia talking to the
psychonaut in the Dreamtime language of trips (Salvia, the
tripper, and  the trip, the physical and the spiritual
becoming indistinguishable, as happens in Dreamtime).<p>

As I said, it's a "nonsense" poem, or perhaps a "non-sense"
poem, so don't try to read it like a text, for it's not
about consensus reality. Still it says some things about
Salvia. Just let it wash over you. Perhaps while besaged.<p></TD>
