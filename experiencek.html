I packed a regular tobacco pipe with just about two good-sized dried leaves.
 Knowing that I should not pack it too tight, but wanting to get a whole
load in  there, I left enough space for what I thought would be a nice,
easily-burning experience.  It was filled to the brim, and I lit it and
proceeded to take in huge hits exactly as one would with cannabis.  Of
course, with a tobacco pipe instead, but hey.
<P>
First hit, I felt a little bit.  I felt something reminiscent of a
marijuana buzz.  It was greatly physical and quite relaxing, like alcohol
without any inebriating, dummying-down, or dizzying, stammering effect.
Felt as if it hadn't crept up from my body to my skull.  Kinda said, Let's
do more.  I felt a little more the second hit--these were *huge* hits.
Monstrously so, that I amazed myself that so much could be taken in and
expelled from my nose and mouth with such flowing delicacy.  It has been
some time since I've toked on much of anything, but I seem to have taken in
twice my maximum amount in my marijuana days.  I thought that this was
fairly mild going down, actually; easily controllable.  After the second
hit, I started to feel something coming on, thought quite different from
the cannabis parade that walks across my limbs and leaves me feeling
heavily drugged.  There was absolutely none of this.  I felt myself being
pulled in and pushed out of the chair.  Also, I felt as if something were
trying to penetrate my thick head--something saying, Get the hell out and
open up!  This is wonderful!  You don't want to miss anymore!.....Third
hit, I really was able to take a lot in, and I felt my body be pleasantly
lifted from the chair as I was filling myself with this smoke.  I actually
felt myself sinking into the chair at the same time as I felt incredibly
light--as if I weighed nothing any longer.  Very nice.
<P>
This third hit was magnificent.  And I held it in for about 20 seconds or
so, feeling it pulled deeper into my lungs, or so it felt, the whole time.
I felt my senses transform in a way that was quite interesting, in that
there was really nothing I could pinpoint as "different."  Then I realized
that I was seeing the world for the first time, in a quite real and
convincing way.  But it was harsh:  it was a flash of sensory overload.  It
was as if there were a certain barrier that this salvinorin passed through,
and then, there I was, immediately:  in a completely different place.  It
pushed me through some kind of membrane, and it happened in the blink of my
mind's eye.  Feeling the whole garage (I know, what a setting) become
brighter than anything I have ever imagined, very unfamiliar because it
seemed so real.  It leapt from the usual mundane view to something so
frighteningly *in-my-face* that it was as if I had never known it, seen it
before.  Never seen ANYthing.  As I exhaled this smoke, so deliberately and
slowly, I realized that I could freak out--this was a complete shift in
reality.  This was like having new existential eyes.  I mean, it was the
same me, the same place, the same eyes, senses, and feeling--but there was
something shockingly ineffable about it.  And wasn't I supposed to feel
*fucked-up* if I was on this intense a trip?
<P>
It was as if I had been born again.  But it was not exactly so, because I
didn't feel really "different."  What was it????
<P>
Well, as if to answer my question, a whole layer of reality ricocheted out
of space into my head.  A sound:  a voice, and a whole bunch of
some-sort-of-smurf-elf-like creatures that seem to comprise DMT hyperspace.
I swear to you, there were entities there, and they were playing!  They
were dancing and swirling, laughing and living in complete, unadulterated
bliss!  I could glance at them, astonished and with my eyes probably as
wide as the gap between my chin, as it lay on the floor, and my upper lip.
Real animals came out of nowhere and all of a sudden I was on the verge of
their village!  It was like this, I was watching one of those jukeboxes,
except that it is an experiential jukebox, and the records are not just
phonographs, and they are not recorded sounds of us humans and our music,
and they are unreal, in this respect; these *are* layers of reality, and
one of them just flipped out from the astral pile in my consciousness (or
was it really just my consciousness??) and played to my mind in vivid
detail.  It was as if I was the needle, as crazy as I know this sounds, and
the life of a whole fucking cosmos was being played to my Soul, as
encaptured by some layer/disc of reality.  That is what it seemed like.
<P>
<P>
These things, they flashed so quickly before me, they said "Come play with
us!  Come on and join us!  Come here and rid yourself of all your worrying
and your shit!  *Dammit* come on!"  And they were flying before my open
eyes, as if to wash everything else out.  They did look like smurfs, yet
they weren't blue and they weren't fucking annoying.  They were more like
elves, gnomes, yes, and they were, well, quite paradoxical.  Like
enlightened children.  Like a totally different representation of cosmic
intelligence than you would expect.  (I did not think God was in an elf!
but, alas, there was a spirit of that very character in them.)  And it was
almost cartoonish, it was so colorful.  The "derealized" cartoonish take of
this quite freaked me out, as it was SO real, yet SO foreign to anything I
had imagined.  This was some sort of truth.  This whole galaxy that was
flipped over so I could see it, I could leap into.  But something was
keeping me back.  I was scared to the core that I would never come back.
<P>
This was so real, for a moment I wholly forgot that I was "tripping."  I
hate that term, it is hackneyed and insufficient.  This was a "journey" and
a consciousness dance, but nothing short of mind-blowing and quite real in
spirit.  There was no sense of inebriation, and when I stopped to grab a
hold of my normal scope of reality--as it was always palpable, if need
be--I could be normalized.  And then I noticed that there was a difference.
I slipped out of this flash, it was like.  I was slipping out and this
voice, half androgynous, half feminine, said "Come back..." in a whisper
that was both warm and insistent--over my left shoulder and floating
everywhere.   I tried to see her, turning my head like a fool, or dog trying
to chase his tail; she is Elsewhere, yet always aside me.  (I've had the
sense of a third party before, stone-cold sober, and felt it a spiritual
overseer, or guardian.)  Seemed like some sort of angel who wanted to get
things done and wanted to Truly, finally communicate to me.  I said to it,
"I have to go let people know that I am going to be leaving for a while.
They'll come back and I'll be gone!  My mom will come out and I will not
have warned her that I was going to a whole different universe and she will
be freaked that I look as if in a coma!"  I was seeing so many different
things come to me at once, and I felt my body overload.  I was at the point
that I thought I could do anything I wanted, simply effortlessly, but the
sheer overly-puissant Power of this was too much for me.  I could barely
walk to the door to the house to yell, "Mom! Dad!" quite rushed and
insistently, myself.  "Just so you know, I am tripping hard!"  They were my
sitters for this.  Quite nice.  (Needless to say, they are quite interested
in the potential of psychedelics, as they have shown great promise to help
their son out of a series of psychological and spiritual setbacks that have
left me largely paralyzed and in need of "healing", in whatever forms
work...)
<P>
"Really!?!?" my Mom returned.  I said, Yes, that I needed to go sit down
and be comfortable, this was coming on much more quickly than I thought.
<P>
I sat back in the chair, and I still heard the mutterings of the creatures
I had neared--whose activities I really only saw from a distance and into
whose world I was not able to take a leap.  I still saw kind of ghostly,
transparent and existentially-fleeting hallucinations of their activity,
and the angel in white whose presence seems to have never left my side,
including my life before this capriole.  She was the Center *and* the
circling orb around me, at the same time:  I was ego, and she was there to
take me; and she was the Host Whom I should worship.  And I actually spoke
to something, out loud, yet as the words came out of my mouth I wasn't sure
if it was to Her....And I still can validate that I corresponded with
something; I said that I would come back, and that I wanted them to make it
easy for me to sink on through to the other side.  Could they please not
make this a disaster and me a catatonic schizophrenic....I told him that I
like holding on to "these eyes, this ego."  And that I appreciate the
beauty and endless wonder that they hold.  I kind-of said, Be patient with
me, too.  I had the power to conjure them, or have them *cooperate* with
me.
<P>
I had not yet realized the significance of open-eyes versus closed-eyes.
At this point, my eyes had yet to be closed.  I was experiencing enough
dimensional shifting without going inward.
<P>
Letting my Mom know that I thought I was about to be going someplace very
alien, I proceeded to take yet another large hit.  No effect.  I was
already departed from the otherworldly reality.  Very interesting--it was
as if I had had one chance with this smoking session, and it was decided
that I was not equipped or ready to go through with it.  This hit was
astronomical, too.  Yet, no dancing with the friendly-from-afar and highly
<P>
imaginative creatures.  Damn, I had barely seen but a slice of the world of
the Veiled Lady's, and her seeming governship of divine elf-like gnome-like
playthings.  I was certain, and still am, that I saw but a snapshot of a
whole powerful, energetic, quite-real dimension to our lives.  I went
inside to close my eyes and see what remained of this dimension.
<P>
Lay down, closed my eyes, and asked some questions to myself, like, What do
I make of this, Am I nuts, Isn't this only supposed to happen on DMT, How
do I feel free and secure enough to let go???  Visions and predominantly
warm emotions danced spectacularly around and about me.  I was seeing a
good chunk of the things I've imagined, from dragons to demons to mermaids
to god to wildlife to every dream I've ever had, and all with enough beauty
and overwhelmment to occupy my whole Soul as I lay down and went with what
was left.  (This was only about 12 or so minutes after my first toke.)
There was a stream of mild and seemingly still sexual imagery, and emotion
was running from all sorts of hope, and amazement, and excitation, to
calmness, contentment, and also some dejection that the experience seemed
to have been "cut off" and I was not really "going with it."
<P>
I could open my eyes and return to 85% of reality around me as I knew it.
Then I could shut up, shut out the things around me, and enter a dream.
This was very peculiar and genius for me!  I realized that I DO have a fear
of letting go, of being free, if you will, and of truly succumbing to the
*whole* effects of this.  And then many implications hit me about my life,
and what real problems I face, and that same old "stuff."  I was amazed
that there seemed to be Answers, if I could only take that huge "leap of
faith."  I realize now that this leap of faith is truly a dying and
rebirthing experience.  It truly is.  Anyhow, I digress....The salvia
divinorum showed me that there is something waiting beyond the realms of
our normal human imagination, and that it "takes you places..."
<P>
This was a feeble attempt to capture something that I still cannot believe
flew into my head, and smacked me across the face.  The effulgent image
that I am left with, that I spoke of as my own mother watched me "watch"
the abstract goings-on in my mind, is of me being sucked from this world,
which I really feel I have yet to truly enter.  Am dissociated from
myself....and this stuff picked me up out of this and left me dangling,
saying *over* and not just *to* me, "You are nowhere!  I can put you in two
places at once and you can live both, more really than you are here now,
when sober!"
<P>
And it dangled me, this Force, this Shepherdess, and presented me this
world--multiplied by 100--at the same time as it presented me Its own
special and unique, transdimensional world.  It said, "You can do much
better than this!  You have no idea!"
<P>
And so I was shown that perhaps what we have been enculterated to seeing is
not necessarily "real" after all.  Especially if we can go places and come
back with this endlessly enriched by the journey.  What a vacation!  That
is what this is like--a ticket that I have to be reassured deep within, is
two-way.  I still am at the gate and window, waving to energies and
entities which are flying by. </TD>
