<CENTER><i>Pages of Time</i> was my second vision, not unlike the "flip book" pictures you would draw in the corner of a book.<BR>
I was brought back to what visually looked like being caught between pages as they were forming in time.<BR>
The right side of the room slowly structured a solid room.<BR>
The middle, a comic stretched like on a piece of Silly Putty.<BR>
The left side of the room, not yet totally formed.<BR>
I saw what could only be explained as the pages of time.</CENTER><P><BR>
