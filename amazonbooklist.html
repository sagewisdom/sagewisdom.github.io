Entheogenic Drugs Their Plant Sources and Histories</A><BR>
by Jonathan Ott.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Probably the most comprehensive book on entheogens available in the English language. It reads like a scientific review article—albeit one of 638 pages! The
book is not recommended for those wanting a quick introduction into the field
of entheogens. One should expect complete pages filled with botanical names
and complex chemical names. For those used to reading scientific literature,
here finally is a book that takes the well informed reader seriously. Ott also
includes results of several very informative self-experiments and has an
opinion on the whole issue of entheogenic use that deserves wider consideration.</FONT><P>

of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing and Hallucinogenic Powers</A><br>
by Richard Evans Schultes, Albert Hofmann.<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The use of hallucinogenic plants has been a part of human experience for millennia, yet modern Western societies have only recently become aware of the significance that these plants have had in shaping the history of diverse cultures. Capable of bringing human beings in closer touch with the spirit worlds, hallucinogenic plants have long been venerated as aids to mental health and as the sacred connection to the mystical. The authors of this definitive book examine the cross-cultural ceremonial and ritual use of many hallucinogenic substances. Profusely illustrated, this book contains an extensively researched plant lexicon, providing common and botanical names, history, ethnography, preparation, chemical components, usage in healing, and effects for 91 hallucinogenic plants.<p>

Dr. Mark Plotkin, of Conservation International writes: "An extraordinary blend of botany, ethnobotany, chemistry, history, mythology, and art. A visual, spiritual, and intellectual feast, Plants of the Gods is the best book ever written on hallucinogenic plants and it was written by the two most knowledgeable people on the planet".

by Christian Ratsch.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The beautifully illustrated Plants of Love explores the history, culture, and religious beliefs related to plants used as aphrodisiacs. There are an amazing number of plants thought to help with impotency, enhance lovemaking, or even cause people to fall in love. Christian Ratsch employs medieval European paintings, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Tibetan folk art, and erotic Asian silkscreens to enhance the lively text, stories, and information on the safe use of these special plants. An eye-opening array of plants and herbs--including nettles, asparagus, seeds of the iboga bush, and ginseng--are discussed in detail to explore and illustrate the science and symbolism of aphrodisiacs throughout history.</FONT>

by Ralph Metzner (Editor), Jace Calloway (Editor), Charles S. Grob (Editor)<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Ayahuasca is a tea made from two plants found, until recently, only in the Amazon basin. Indigenous people of the region have used it for medicinal and shamanic purposes since time immemorial. In the last century, it has been ceremonially incorporated by polyglot Christian/goddess religions springing up in Brazil and by seekers on the margins of consciousness exploration. In this book, Metzner, a hallucinogenic and mystical experience researcher for over 35 years, has compiled essays and journal-type writings from a wide assortment of people who have experienced its divinity-evoking effects--28 scientists, psychologists, chemists, curious laypeople, and practitioners of these religions. While uneven in literary ability, each contributor provides an insightful peek behind the curtain of an experience that until now has been shrouded in tribal secrecy and cult ritual--truly an adventure into the Amazon of the mind.

by Peter T. Furst .<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">For centuries, hallucinogens have been of great significance in the ideology and religious practices of primitive societies. In fact, the use of psychotropic plants to achieve states of religious ecstasy goes back almost to the beginning of human culture. Furthermore, the content of the psychedelic experience in the West today has been found to be similar to that of the religious pilgrimages of Oriental and aboriginal New World groups. But one fundamental difference overshadows all similarities: In the traditional cultures described in this collection of ten essays, the hallucinogenic "trip" is a means to an end--a quest for confirmation of traditional values, for unity with the tribal ancestors. In contemporary Western society, by contrast, it tends to be an end in itself and a rejection of the society's values--perhaps, it has been suggested, because Western drug-users tend to be a-cultural. Clearly, we have much to learn from an objective study of societies with long histories of sanctioned, and controlled, drug use to achieve recognized cultural objectives. </FONT>

in the Forest: How Medicines Are Found in the Natural World</A><br>
by Fred Powledge.<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<I>From Kirkus Reviews , May 15, 1998:</I> A rare, informative resource,
Powledge's book apprises readers of the origins of products they probably know
only from store shelves, and of the world politics involved in the commerce of
medicine. Most people who take Sudafed to relieve a stuffy nose have no idea
their medicine originated as a Chinese plant; through such examples, Powledge
tackles an intriguing subject: The correlation of plants and medicines. He
cites some important statistics that powerfully support the need to protect the
earth's forests: More than half of all drugs currently in use are from nature,
and one in four prescriptions written were originally based on plants. He
explores several major plant-based medicines, e.g., aspirin, ginseng, neem, and
Echinacea, and makes clear that when it comes to knowledge of plant medicine,
modern cultures are deeply indebted to so-called primitive cultures and their
experiences with indigenous plants. He's not shy about pointing a finger at and
naming drug companies who have been reluctant to credit or pay for information
from developing countries. Due to the nature of the book, there are provisos
here of the don't-try-this-at-home kind, while a list of related web sites
expands this volume beyond its covers. (glossary) (Nonfiction. 9-13) --

of a Shaman's Apprentice: An Ethnobotanist Searches for New Medicines in the
Amazon Rain Forest</A><br>
by Mark J. Plotkin.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">A century ago, malaria was killing Washingtonians, Londoners, Parisians. Today HIV, along with various cancers, has taken its place among worldwide epidemics. Quinine, extracted from the cinchona tree of the Amazonian rainforest, quelled malaria; alkaloids taken from trees in the West African rainforest may well yield a cure for AIDS. Yet those woods, Mark Plotkin tells us, are fast disappearing, along with the native peoples who know the powers of the plants that dwell there. His account of wandering through the Amazonian jungles focuses on local knowledge about plants, whose uses range from the mundane to the magical. The rainforests of the world, Plotkin notes, are our greatest natural resource, an intercultural pharmacy that can cure woes both known and yet unvisited.</FONT><p>

Shaman's Apprentice: A Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest</A><br>
by Lynne Cherry, Mark J. Plotkin.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Ages 5-9. The author of The Great Kapok Tree (1990) takes us back to the Amazon rain forest, this time teaming up with ethnobotanist Plotkin. Together, they present a story in which a lesson about medicinal herbs is brought to life through young Kamanya, who dreams of becoming his tribe's next shaman. Kamanya spends his time following the current shaman into the forest and learning the secrets of the plants. But local plants can't cure the new diseases brought to the area by strangers, and the pills the strangers bring with them cause the indigenous people to lose faith in the ability of their shaman. Eventually a woman named Gabriella, who comes to study the properties of the rain forest plants, restores the tribe's faith. The lush illustrations make the story a visual pleasure. Even the endpapers are rich in detail, picturing some of the rain forest plants and noting their uses. Like other books Cherry has worked on, this one, which is based on a true story, is a unusual addition to rain forest literature. It will be useful not only for story hours but also as a springboard for classroom discussion for older children as well as younger ones.

by Terence McKenna.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Here, this consummate storyteller tells of his first life-changing encounter with magic mushrooms, in 1971 in the Colombian Amazon. Veteran of the Berkeley riots of the 1960's and of a self- imposed exile in India and Indonesia--during which he smoked pot, studied alternative religions, collected butterflies, and steered clear of the FBI--McKenna was inspired in 1971 to journey to La Chorrera, Colombia, in search of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca and any plants containing the hallucinogenic drug DMT. Joined by his devoted 18-year-old brother, Dennis, and by several other Americans, McKenna reached the Putumayo River only to be sidetracked by a chance ingestion of some magic mushrooms growing in a field. One mushroom led to another, and soon the wildly philosophizing Dennis had devised an experiment to determine whether the production of a cicada-like noise could bind the wisdom of the mushroom with his own DNA. The local Indians may have laughed as the Americans stumbled through the rain forest chasing flying saucers and talking to themselves, but McKenna's newfound conviction that the mushroom showed the way to higher consciousness determined the very uneven course of his future life and career.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
THE PEYOTE ROAD addresses the United States Supreme Court &#147;Smith&#148;
decision, which denied protection of 1st Amendment religious liberty to the
sacramental use of Peyote for Indigenous people, one of the oldest tribal
religions in the Western Hemisphere. Examining the European tradition of
religious intolerance &amp; documenting the centuries old sacramental use of
the cactus Peyote, THE PEYOTE ROAD explains how the &#147;Smith&#148; decision
put religious freedom in jepordy for all Americans. This program contributed to
the successful efforts of The American Indian Religious Freedom Coalition,
resulting in passage of the historic 1994 amendment to The American Indian
Religious Freedom Act. (reviewed by LER)</FONT></P>

Vannithone (Illustrator), Pam Hoenig (Editor).<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
&quot;Its' a truly invaluable trove of culinary historical, and botanical
knowledge,&quot; wrote Gourmet's book reviewer in 1997, lamenting that Uncommon
Fruits and Vegetables was out of print. Now the classic has returned in its
original hard cover. Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables was published in 1986 to a
fanfare of outstanding reviews: &quot;If there were Emmys or Oscars for
cookbooks, Elizabeth Schneider would surely receive one&quot; Boston Globe;
&quot;the book has already become a must-have&quot; Bon Appetite; &quot;the
timeliest and most truly helpful book of the year,&quot; proclaimed Time
magazine. More timely than ever, the visionary volume includes produce now
available nationwide -- arugula, mango, kiwi, snow peas, and Swiss chard, as
well as less familiar passion fruit, carambola, tamarillo, and chanterelles.
Backdrops rich in culinary, botanical, and historical information set the stage
for nearly 100 of these produce items. Detailed methods of selection, storage,
and preparation lead to more than 400 easy-to-follow recipes designed to bring
out the best in each fruit and vegetable. (reviewed by LER)</FONT></P>

by Robert Root-Bernstein, Michele Root-Bernstein.<br>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
Eating clay, drinking urine, applying honey to deep wounds and mere
plaster to crushed bones: these are all folk remedies for ailments, passed on
through the generations and thoroughly discounted by modern science. It is too
bad, write scientist-historian couple Robert and Mich&egrave;le Root-Bernstein,
who deplore the loss of proven methods developed without the blessing of the
academy, noting that &quot;formal academic systems are only one of many ways in
which knowledge is discovered, accumulated, and transmitted.&quot; Many
scientists are now coming to agree with this view, they write in this
fascinating collection of case studies. Researchers have showed that black tea,
for instance, has powerful antibiotic properties and that maggots do an
extraordinary job of cleaning wounds--as traditional healers have known all
along. (reviewed by LER)</FONT></P>
