INTRODUCTION:<BR>
The following experience came from dosing with tincture using the staggered
method of taking three 1 ml dropper loads of tincture at a time, holding it in my
mouth and waiting 4 minutes before swallowing each time, three times in a row
for a total of 9 dropper loads full in a period of 12 minutes.<P><BR>


THE EXPERIENCE:<BR>
I found myself in a trance-like dream, dreaming that I was someone else. I
was a young kid who had fallen onto a dusty road and got some dirt in his
eyes.<P>

My father helped me up and wiped the earth out of my eyes. As he was
doing so, this reality, this place, this Earth disappeared, wiped away by his
handkerchief. I saw my earthly reality as a dark stained mark on that white cloth
in his hand, and it all pulled away from me as he withdrew the cloth and crumpled
it up, closing it in his fist. He said, "You know, you ought to be careful not to let
that earth get in your eyes. If you do, you soon lose all contact with who you
really are, getting all wrapped up in that strange place, believing that it is real."
Then he said, "You can live a lifetime there and not know that it is just earth in
your eyes."<P>

The thought then occurred to me, how strange the experience was, that I actually had a whole life in that place, a place that had such things as cats and dogs. I thought that it was all very weird; nothing like that really existed. I was glad that I had returned to reality, as a kid in my father's arms. The Earth was just a dream.<P>

Then I was back, more earth in my eyes. Cats and dogs are real again!<p><BR>


<b>ADDITIONAL NOTES:</b><BR>
When I experienced this it was as if I were both watching from the outside
while at the same time experiencing it from the perspective of the child.<P>

When I was a very young boy I used to view cats and dogs as opposites and
because of this I believe their role in this vision represented the concept
of good and evil, light and darkness, the outward flow and inward pull.
