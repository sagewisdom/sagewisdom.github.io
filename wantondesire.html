<b>INTRODUCTION:</b> This is a piece I've already shared with several folks who were with me at 
the 1999 Breitenbush Salvia conference, some of whom shared the session 
the poem refers to. The piece came to me spontaneously when I returned to 
my cabin after a session in the sanctuary in which we shared Sage Goddess 
Emerald Essence. I did not 'craft' it; it came to me into my journal as 
you read it now in one fell swoop or even more as one 'swell foop.'<br><br>

Our group had started out as just six of us but—as these things
go—inexplicably <I>and</I> inextricably—grew to a dozen. Also, I approached the
invitation to join with my two inner voices in conflict; and rather than
follow my usual dictum, 'when in doubt, don't,' I went ahead. One voice, my
lefthand dark guardian Azazel, said: 'do it, Will; you've spent all your
money here so you won't have a chance to sample it otherwise until a couple
weeks after you return home and send to Daniel for it!' The other voice, Lee
my righthand angel of light, said: 'you will know when it is best for you to
partake; it is not now, in this strange place among strangers, even with
these friendly strangers!'<br><br>

We formed our circle, introduced ourselves, stating how strong a dose we
would take and sharing our intentions. I had decided on 3 undiluted
droppersful, a moderate dose; some were going to have one or two dropper
loads, many were going to dilute the liquid—about as strong as
everclear—with hot water. Most people stated a respectful and respectable
intention; I perhaps foolishly thought mine equally appropriate: 'you have
shown me, Ska Pastora, what you have to show on other occasions when I have
chewed or smoked you; show me now your power in this form.' Then, when we
were passing the bottle and dropper, on the third round a bit dribbled down
my lip, so I decided to squirt a fourth load in, not consciously realizing
that this would nudge my dose into the strong category.<br><br>

We had decided to douse the lights when we were done with the circle work.
As you will see below, I was unprepared for the suddenness and strength of
the trip I was now on. But then, like some other intrepid psychedelic
explorers, let alone the sorcerer's apprentice, I have at other times over
the past 35 years or so found myself beyond the M.C. Escher beyond as I
begin the entheogenic beguine.<P><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1">she will not suffer fools<br>
i knew that<br>
waiting at her gate<br>
it was not my time<br>
but wanton desire beckoned<br>
almost roared<br>
so i let myself be blinded<br>
even though the snow was melting<br>
so it wasn't that<br>
even though the circle was imperfect<br>
but it wasn't that<br>
even though i'd heard no call<br>
so it was that<br><br>

so when i communed with her<br>
in that refuge from the snow<br>
darkness descended before i knew it<br>
walls folded impossibly outwardly in<br>
escaping voices twisted away<br>
i lay alone in the desacrated temple<br>
its heaving walls an unfunhouse ride<br>
she would not suffer fools<br><br>

i reached up to broken shards<br>
then down to a vagrant pillow<br>
broken slants of light<br>
more distant muffled sighs<br>
all was riven now<br>
perhaps never whole<br>
i knew not how i'd come<br>
to this crazy house<br>
i must go out<br>
if there were an out<br><br>

rolling over i found a wall<br>
then the broken sharp things again<br>
then—somehow not surprisingly—<br>
a berber carpet under me<br>
i rolled some more<br>
hands fumbled on an edge<br>
reached down<br>
a stair<br>
another<br>
i dragged my belly my knees<br>
came almost head over heals<br>
(head over heals?)<br>
boarding down the stairs<br>
arms and legs my wheels<br>
but she stopped me—<br>
no, not SHE, but just she—<br>
and asked me where i was going<br><br>

'oh, someone's here!'<br>
yes<br>
come back<br>
i crawled back in the dark<br>
back into the broken temple<br>
less broken now<br>
but no less desacralized<br>
'ouch! you're stepping on me!'<br>
the stepping stopped<br>
sorry! came a distant sigh<br><br>

as light and sanity blinked on<br>
we all held our breath for both<br>
i glimpsed the menacing shards<br>
merely seashells along the wall<br>
we gradually told our stories—<br>
those who desired—<br>
lawnmower man his<br>
green goddess lady hers<br>
one had disappeared<br>
another stayed grimly silent<br>
a hand over his face<br>
we chatted we laughed we humans<br>
but it was never right<br>
foolish wanton deed<br>
but it was done—good to go<br><br>
