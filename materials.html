  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fieldwork carried out during the winter of 1983-84 consisted mainly of
searching the Sierra Mazateca for populations of <i>S. divinorum</i>.  Flowering
populations near Cerro Quemado, a village on the western side of the Aleman
Dam, were visited in October, 1985, and watched for two days and one night in
order to note any visitors to the flowers.  Plants were observed during the
night by periodical inspection using a red-filtered incandescent lamp.  After
being visited, flowers were inspected to see whether pollen had been deposited
on the stigma, and whether the store of nectar had been depleted.
<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plants of <i><i>S. divinorum</i></i> from several sources were 
propagated at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison Botany Department (UW) Greenhouses.  Valdes
generously provided potted plants derived from three sources: a collection
from Cerro Rabon, near the Mazatec village of Ayautla, a collection from near
the village of Cerro Quemado, and clonotypic material obtained from Berkeley. 
Later, plants I collected near Cerro Quemado (<i>Reisfield & Solheim 1102</i>) and
Ayautla (<i>Reisfield & Solheim 1102</i>) were added to the living collections.
<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valdes learned from Robert Ornduff (pers. com.) that plants grown in the
gardens at both UC Berkeley and UCLA formed flower buds that subsequently
reverted to vegetative growth.  (This, in fact, also occurred on plants
growing in the UW greenhouses during the winter of 1986-87).  Apparently, a
limited exposure to light during the night will upset the hormonal mechanism
by which the plant perceives a decrease in daylength.  Thus, beginning in late
October, 1984, a subset of plants at the UW greenhouses were subjected to
artificially shortened days of 8-10 hours by covering them with a black cloth
each afternoon.
<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers were hand-pollinated by removing the stamens and immediately
brushing the dehiscing anthers against the inner surfaces of both stigma
branches until pollen grains adhered to the stigma.  Self-pollinations were
performed within individual flowers, between flowers of the same plant, and
between plants derived from a common source, while cross-pollinations were
performed between plants derived from different sources.  Pollinations were
performed at different times during the day (and night), and between flowers
of different ages.
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To study pollen germination and pollen tube growth, styles were collected
from flowers that had been self- or cross-pollinated between 4 and 18 hrs
earlier.  The styles were fixed in FAA and stored in distilled water at
approximately 5¯C.  They were cleared with 8N sodium hydroxide for 24 hrs,
then taken through several washes with distilled water, and stained with
aniline blue at a concentration of .01 percent for 4 hrs.  Fluorescence
microscopy was performed with a Zeiss microscope equipped with a Zeiss UG1
excitation filter and 47,-65 barrier filters.  The UV source was an Osram HBO
200W mercury vapor lamp.  Staining and microscopy techniques mostly followed
Martin (1959) as modified by Stettler and Guries (1976).  Styles were slightly
crushed beneath a coverslip and observed whole in a darkened room.  The
callosic lining of the pollen tubes fluoresces a bright yellow-green, but the
amount and distribution of callose varies between taxa (Martin 1959). 
Scanning several unrelated species of <i>Salvia</i> showed that pollen tubes come in
and out of visibility over the length of the style, and can easily be
distinguished from the two vascular bundles which fluoresce a uniform, much
less brilliant yellow.  Since fluorescence was most visible at the stigmatic
and ovary ends of the style, an inability of the tubes to reach the ovary
should have been readily detectable. <p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollen grains from FAA-preserved flowers on wild and greenhouse-grown
plants were analyzed for cytoplasm stainability.  Sterile or aborted pollen
grains did not take up the cotton blue-lactophenol stain, and were also
conspicuous by their shrunken size and shriveled form.
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nectar studies included an analysis of constituents, a study of daily
secretion patterns, and also total volumes produced per flower.  Calibrated
micropipettes were inserted into the pool of nectar that accumulates at the
base of the corolla tube, with nectar extracted by capillary action.  Sugar
concentrations were measured with an Extech model 2132 pocket refractometer,
with several nectar samples also analyzed for sugar constituents (ratio) by
Irene Baker at UC Berkeley.  The nectar was spotted on Whatman #2 filter
paper, the diameter of the spot outlined with four pencil marks, and the
volume and percent sugar for each spot provided to Dr. Baker.
<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young anther sacs were dissected and meiocytes squashed according to the
technique of Beeks (1955).  These were viewed with a Zeiss phase-contrast
microscope.
