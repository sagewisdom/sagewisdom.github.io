This recipe makes enough tea for 8 to 16 mild doses, 4 medium-strength doses, or two moderately strong doses. People vary in sensitivity to kratom, and different batches of kratom vary in potency, so these dosage estimates should be regarded as loose approximations. One should always start with a low dose when experimenting with a new batch of kratom. One can then increase the dose gradually with subsequentt experiments until one finds the dose that one is comfortable with.<P>
 
STEP 1: Take 50 grams of dried, crushed kratom leaves and put into a pot. To this add 1 liter of water.<P>

STEP 2: Boil gently for 15 minutes.<P>

STEP 3: Pour the tea through a strainer into a bowl and reserve the liquid. Squeeze the leaves in the strainer to get most of the liquid out.<P>

STEP 4: Put the leaves back in the pot and add another liter of fresh water. Repeat steps 2 and 3.<P>

STEP: 5: After the leaves have been strained a second time, they can be discarded. Put the combined liquid from both boilings back into the pot and boil until the volume is reduced to about 100 ml.<P>

Note regarding step 5: The general idea is to boil the tea down to a small quantity so that an individual dose can be quickly swallowed. I suggest boiling the tea made from 50 grams of leaf down to about 100 ml, but you can boil it down to what ever concentration you are comfortable with. Be careful not to boil it down too much. If it starts to become syrupy, it may spatter and/or burn.<P>

The tea is bitter tasting. I recommend gulping it down quickly, and then immediately chasing it with some pleasant-tasting fruit juice.<P>
 
Kratom tea can be safely stored in the refrigerator for about 5 days. It is probably okay to keep it a bit longer, but it's better to play it safe and not drink it after 5 days. It can be stored for many months if you add some alcohol to it. Adding about 10% alcohol will preserve it for many months (in the refrigerator). That is 1 part 80 proof vodka (or a similar spirit) to 3 parts kratom tea.<P>

The same general preparation method can of course be used with larger or smaller amounts of herb by simply adjusting the volume of water used. Many people experience nausea when using doses above 25 grams. Some highly sensitive individuals experience nausea when using doses above 15 grams. When taking larger doses, it is best to do so on an empty stomach (i.e. wait about 3 hours after eating).
