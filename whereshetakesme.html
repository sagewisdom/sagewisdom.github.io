it starts<br>
suddenly<br>
with a circle<br>
circular motion<br>
a sense of movement<br>
going counterclockwise<br>
and it feels<br>
it feels like it comes<br>
out of<br>
my mouth<br>
the left side<br>
of my face<p>

a scatter pattern<br>
a pattern<br>
a scatter<br>
left to right<br>
if there is<br>
a left<br>
a right<br>
a pull<br>
a circularity<br>
a circle<br>
around me<br>
above me<br>
from me<p>

I am both<br>
inside it<br>
like a big cavern<br>
a huge room<br>
a cathedral<br>
I am both<br>
the inside<br>
and the outside<p>

and I don't know<br>
I don't know how<br>
I don't know how to<br>
move<br>
or swim<br>
through this space<p>

and I keep thinking<br>
it's growing<br>
growing out of my body<br>
growing out of my face<br>
spinning out<br>
of my body<br>
and wondering where my body<br>
is<p>

and I want to relax<br>
and just wonder<br>
at the beauty<br>
of it all<p>

but a part of<br>
me<br>
a part of me is<br>
saying<br>
where am I<br>
not as in what is this place<br>
where is this place<br><br>
but<br>
where is my body<p>

because it's like<br>
pure consciousness<br>
without<br>
without any physical sense<p>

but I feel like I<br>
like I should be inside<br>
this space I've created<p>

instead<br>
I<br>
am<br>
the<br>
space<p>

and this time it is<br>
pastel green<br>
but another time it was<br>
pink luminescent light<p>

and it's made of<br>
me<br>
it's made of<br>
my face<br>
repeating<P>


over&over&over&over&over &<br>
like a patchwork<br>
well not really<br>
a woven fabric<p>

and it would be very peaceful<br>
except for me<br>
wondering<br>
where my body's gone<br>
where my body's gotten to<br>
and if it will ever<br>
come<br>
back<p>

or will I ever find my way<br>
back<p>

whatever that means<br>
or<br>
is<p>

so I want to let go<br>
to explore<br>
to swim<p>

and it's huge<br>
and it's vast<br>
and it's cavernous<p>

and afterwards<br>
there is this <br>
deep<br>
profound <br>
sense of<br>
regret<br>
because I couldn't<br>
stay<br>
longer<p>

it is the place I have always <br>
wanted to be<P>

it is the place I have<br>
always looked for<p>

it is me<br>
