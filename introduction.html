&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Of the almost 1000 species of <i>Salvia</i> in the world, none has fired the
imagination as much as <i><i>Salvia</i> divinorum</i> Epling & Jativa-M, the enigmatic
species ceremoniously employed by the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico.  The
western world first learned of this salvia, or sage, in 1962, when Epling and
J tiva-M described the entity from specimens given to them by Albert Hofmann
and Gordon Wasson (Wasson 1962; Hofmann 1980), naming it <i><i>S. divinorum</i></i> after
its reported use in divination and curing by the Mazatec.  Hofmann, the
chemist famous for discovering LSD and isolating psylocybin and lysergic acid
amides from the mushrooms and morning glories used by the Mazatecs, had
explored the Sierra Mazateca that year with Wasson, the self-styled
ethnomycologist who pioneered the investigations into the Mazatec rituals. 
The two criss-crossed the rugged highlands on horseback searching for <i>S.
divinorum</i> in the wild, but never were able to locate it.  The flowering
branches that eventually reached Epling were brought to Hofmann and Wasson by
Indians in the village of San Jose Tenango, though no one was willing to take
them to a living plant.  Wasson (1962), therefore, concluded that <i>S. divinorum</i>
is a cultigen that may not exist in the wild state.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Because of the aura of secrecy surrounding <i>S. divinorum</i>, the scientific
community has not known of this species until recently.  A botanist making
general collections is not likely to collect <i>S. divinorum</i> because its
distribution is highly restricted and its flowering infrequent, thus the few
existing collections of this species have all been made in conjuntion with
ethnological investigations.

   Several aspects concerning this species beg inspection: it has been found
growing only in the region inhabited by the Mazatec Indians; no plants have
ever been observed to set seed in the wild; and though plants may be found
flowering at any time from October until May, they apparently rarely do so. 
The corolla conformation suggests no clear pollination syndrome and the
flowers do not point to any obvious taxonomic affinities within <i>Salvia</i>.  These
and other questions regarding the biological status of <i>S. divinorum</i> cannot be
fully understood without consideration of the magico-divinatory aspects of the
species.  Although information regarding the Mazatecs is limited, recent
interest in these people and their medico-religious approach to healing has
shed light on certain facts that may be relevant to the natural history of the
species, as the pertinent writings of Wasson and Valdes have elucidated
(Wasson 1962, 1963, 1980; Wasson et al. 1974; Wasson & Wasson 1957; Valdes
1983; Valdes et al. 1983; Valdes et al. 1987).
