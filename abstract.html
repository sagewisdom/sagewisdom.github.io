sierra inhabited by the Mazatec, its distribution anthropogenic.  Plants spread vegetatively,
flourishing in shaded, humid sites, flowering sporadically from October until June.  Flower
nectar and corolla dimensions suggest ornithophily, and the only pollination event observed
involved a single hummingbird, but other factors suggest that visits by birds to the flowers in
their present range are opportunistic, and not a product of plant-pollinator co-evolution.  The
species is diploid with n=11, pollen fertility is reduced, there is no active pollen tube
inhibition within the style, but some event or process after the pollen tube reaches the ovary is
aberrant, as no fully developed nutlet has ever been collected from a Mexican plant, and
greenhouse cross-pollinations led to only 3% seed set.  Hybridity is suggested, although
intermediacy between two known species has not been recognized.
