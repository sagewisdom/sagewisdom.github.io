<i>Lagochilus inebrians</i> (Labiatae) has long been used for its intoxicating and sedative properties by Tajik, Tartar, Turkoman, and Uzbek tribesman. The species name inebrians refers to its traditional use as an inebriant. It is traditionally taken as a tea. The tea is usually sweetened with honey or sugar to make it more palatable. Alternatively, it can be steeped in alcohol to make a tincture (vodka works fine for this). Less herb is needed per dose when it is taken as a tincture because alcohol is more effective than water at extracting the active constituents. Depending on the method of preparation used and strength of effects desired, dosages may range from approximately 5 to 30 grams.<P>

The effects of the plant have been largely attributed to the diterpene lagochilin. The closely related compounds lagochilin-3-acetate and lagochilin-tetraacetate are also present in the plant and might contribute to the overall effects. This herb also has hypotensive properties (i.e. it lowers blood pressure). Like <i>Salvia divinorum,</i> this is one of the few members of the mint family (Labiatae) that is traditionally used as an inebriant. The most commonly reported effects include relaxation, euphoria, and subtle perceptual changes.<P>

<FONT COLOR="RED" ><b>Caution:</b></FONT> Some vendors are selling herbs as "<i>Lagochilus inebrians</i>" that are not the correct species. At least one vendor has been selling a different species, <i>Lagochilus cabulicus,</i> falsely claiming that it is the same as <i>Lagochilus inebrians.</i> I have analyzed the material offered by that vendor and found that it does not contain lagochilin. Unfortunately, the problem of people selling misidentified herbs is quite common.<P>

Authentic <i>Lagochilus inebrians</i> is now available from <a href="salviashop.html">the Sage Wisdom Salvia Shop.</a><P>

Several years ago, a botanist friend gave me two flowering specimens. This is a photo of one of them.
