<b>BACKGROUND: </b>Salvinorin A is a unique hallucinogen that is seeing increased
use in humans.  It is not currently a controlled substance and is used as a
legal alternative to controlled substances.  Usually smoked or buccally
absorbed by chewing, doses of approximately 200mcg can produce profound
hallucinogenic effects of short duration.  The mechanism of action of
salvinorin A is at the k-opioid recpetor.  Little data is available on the
medical effects of this substance so animal studies were undertaken to
explore the acute toxic effects of this substance in rats and the chronic
effects in mice.<p>

<b>METHODS: </b>Rats were anesthetized and administered salvinorin A at
1600mcg/kg or vehicle.  Recordings were made of galvanic skin response,
EKG, temperature, and pulse pressure for 100 minutes. 
Mice were chronically exposed to vehicle or 400, 800, 1600, 3200, or 6400
mcg/kg of salvinorin A for two weeks.  After exposure the animals were
sacrificed and brain, heart, kidney, bone marrow, blood and spleen were
removed, fixed, sectioned, stained and examined by light microscopy.
Results.  No effects were seen on cardiac conduction, temperature, or
galvanic skin response.  A non-significant rise was seen in pulse pressure.
Histologic studies of spleen, blood, brain, liver, kidney, and bone marrow
did not find any significant histologic changes at any of the doses
examined.<p>

<b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These data suggests that the toxicity of salvinorin A is
relatively low, even at doses many times that of what humans are exposed
to.  However, further studies should be done on blood pressure effects.
The psychological impact of this potent hallucinogen should also be
investigated.<p>
