I was in a cabin in the wooded foothills with a friend
who had experimented with the sage before.  It was
night, cool and peaceful, in the territory of the
coyote, the mountain lion, and of a legendary
rattlesnake that was said to be as long as a man is
tall and as big around as his leg.<P>

	“So, what’s the procedure, here?”<P>

	“Take as big a hit as you can, and hold it as long as
you can.  Here; I'll light it.”<P>

	It had been a long time since I'd smoked anything, so
I hyperventilated to clear my lungs and head, and took
the hit.  I set the pipe on the table between us.  I
told myself that I was on my way, and to be brave.  I
reminded myself that I'd been around the psychedelic
block a time or two before, and that there wasn't much
the world could throw at me that would be weirder than
anything I'd thus far undergone.  When I could no
longer hold the smoke, I exhaled heavily and took a
few deep breaths of clean, mountain air.  Then I
waited.  My partner had told me that the stuff came on
pretty quickly, but my head seemed still to be quite
firmly on my shoulders.  Something, though; something
seemed to be…<P>

	As suddenly as if it had been the inception of time
itself, I realized that I was, and had been for some
while, elsewhere, or elsewhen, or somehow seriously
otherwise.  Sight and vision had been translated into
another sense and sensation, as if hearing and sound
had become taste and scent, except that this new sense
was one I'd never exercised.  The world, the
space-time continuum, had been folded through its four
dimensions from a point in the vicinity of my heart,
as if to be cut into some galaxy-spanning paper
snowflake.  My heart, and not necessarily the one
pumping blood through my cosmos-swimming body, but the
one my ancient Germanic ancestors considered the seat
of consciousness, as in the Old Norse poetic phrase
“the mind within his breast”, was at the center of
this infinite and infinitely folded universe.  And
although everything was awry and I adrift within it, I
felt a balance that was not to be shaken.<P>

	I realized that I was sitting across a table from a
friend of mine, and then remembered that I had
partaken of this new herb.  I felt no fear, but a
concern insistent enough to lead me to remind myself
that the effects were said to be of short duration. 
But what, I had to ask myself, is duration, when time
and space themselves had been twisted into this
bizarre origami?<P>

	I shifted focus between the cabin and the cosmos a
few times.  At one point I found my hand resting on my
leg, and did what I could to lay it on the table.  It
was hard work, but someone had to keep that darn table
from folding into itself and fanning out to the edges
of the universe.<P>

	My focus was again more thoroughly wedded to the
cabin, although I still felt my heart to be a compass
needle drifting at the center of infinitely curved
space.  I took a mental breath, knowing that I was 
coming down, or coming back.  I tried to describe my
experience to my friend, who nodded kindly and
knowingly at my babbling.  I raised my arms and
drifted about the room a bit, almost in a little
dance.  Yes, my heart was at the center of the world,
and though the world was stranger than I'd ever
understood, more crazily and elaborately folded, I was
absolutely balanced.  It was nice to know.<P>

	Then it was his turn, and after that, time to step
out into the wooded darkness and try to catch a
glimpse of that legendary rattlesnake.
