I inhaled one breath full and held it in for about 20 seconds.  I was lying
on my bed on my side, and as soon as I exhaled, I felt pressure all around,
as if I was under a hundred of feet of water.  Then, suddenly, I popped into
ground-zero reality, the right side of my body opened up and I connected
down through the bed, through the floor and foundation of the house into
some immense planetary network, teaming with a multitude of various types
consciousness and intelligence. There was a definite sense of other beings
around me.  I noticed that I was a gravity well, sucking all sound and light
around me into a vortex that had formed in the cusp of my curled body. I was
channeling everything back into the nebulae that I had contacted, I was a
receptor and realized that we all are.  We as humans are mere sense organs
for the planet.  My consciousness then flattened and spread, like dough
under a rolling pin. It then began to separate into 5 distinct autonomous
portions, each one a completely separate and full version of myself.  I
experienced them all simultaneously.  At this point I kind of freaked, not
expecting such a drastic shift in perception.  I thought, "this is way too
much! I wasn't expecting to dissolve and break apart like this!".  I opened
my eyes and sat up. Optic ballets of light and various shapes danced
everywhere around my room, it was alive.  I noticed that all matter is
conscious. I could hear my heart beating. I got up and almost fell over,
which surprised me, I didn't realize it would have a physical affect as
well.  It seemed that I weighed 500lbs and my arms were 12 feet long. I made
it to the kitchen and got a drink of water, then went and laid back down and
entered a trance for what seemed like 20 minutes.  My consciousness and
physical body began twisting and stretching like some bizarre silly putty
being pulled though a cosmic taffy machine.  I had visions of lives playing
out, representing the whole of human experience, love, war, riot and
everything in between. I could clearly see my entire biological history, the
chain of life.  I had somehow accessed my genetic and cellular memory.  All
of my ancestors were present, then I realized that they always are, I just
can't always perceive them. I saw how potentiality becomes reality by force
of will, that thought IS matter.  And I am dead serious when I say this, the
actual physical world around us, meaning even the floor you are standing on,
or the toilet you are pissing into, is created by a consensus of thought
emanating from our multi-dimensional selves, vibrating at varying speeds,
creating first the sub-atomic particles, which then combine and grow, and
combine and grow, and on and on until we have atoms, molecules, proteins,
single-celled organisms, complex organisms, and finally the human and it's
large brain, which can re-access the cellular, molecular and sub-atomic
memories, commune with the just-out-of-perception logos and realize it's
place in the continuum of existence that we ourselves created in the first
place. When I "woke up" from this lucid dream-like state, I saw that about
an hour had passed. The time compression was pronounced, and was very
strange, it really only seemed that twenty minutes at most had passed.I
was surprised that I felt nearly 100% normal. It was an amazing and
beautiful experience, despite the shock of it all.
