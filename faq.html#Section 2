This FAQ was written to provide important educational information about <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> The first version was drafted by "Sage Student," who remains its primary author. Daniel Siebert maintains the FAQ, and as its secondary author, has contributed much additional material over the years. We are grateful for the encouragement of William White, whose early, now obsolete web document, <i>All About</i> Salvia divinorum, provided inspiration for this more up-to-date and comprehensive FAQ. Several members of the original, now defunct, "Salvia" email discussion forum assisted in the development of the preliminary version by providing valuable editorial advice and commentary. Some of them contributed valuable material which has been included in the FAQ. These members include, in alphabetical order: cystonic, damion, DarkCobra, Discarnate Intelligence, Greendrag, infekshun, Gwyllm Llwydd, Will Penna, Todd Pisek, ram, Claude Rifat, Justin Tutty, Leander Valdes III, and TA. Our apologies to anyone whose contributions we have failed to acknowledge. Any such oversight was not intentional.<P>

This is a FAQ (answers to <U>F</U>requently <U>A</U>sked <U>Q</U>uestions) document about
<I>Salvia divinorum</I> and its use. It is NOT intended to either&nbsp; encourage or
discourage use of this plant or any pharmacologically active compound (e.g. salvinorin A) that it contains. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">IT IS INTENDED TO DISCOURAGE IRRESPONSIBLE USE.</FONT> It is intended to make readers more knowledgeable about this interesting plant, its effects, and how it may best be used safely and responsibly by those who choose to do so. Choosing to work with it is a decision that only you can make. One should learn as much as possible about it before going forward with that decision.<p>

The pharmacology of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> and its active principal, salvinorin A,
remain poorly understood. Although <I>Salvia divinorum</I> appears to be remarkably safe in terms of physiological effects, one must bear in mind that very few toxicological studies have been done. Of the studies that have been done, none have demonstrated any significant toxicity for pure salvinorin A. No toxicity is associated with traditional Mazatec methods of oral ingestion. Like tobacco, smoking <I>Salvia divinorum</I> may involve health risks associated with the inhalation of various products of combustion, such tar, carbon monoxide, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--At the time of this writing, <I>Salvia divinorum</I> is legal to posses in all coutries except Australia and Denmark. Italy has a law prohibiting commerce, but not possession. In Finland, it is illegal to import <i>Salvia divinorum</i> without a relevant prescription from a doctor. Given that many conciousness-altering herbs have been pronounced illegal by various governments in the past, it is certailnly possible that other coutries may criminalize it in the future. -->
Don&#39;t use <I>Salvia divinorum</I> (or salvinorin A) anywhere its use
or possession is subject to legal penalty (see section XII, "Legal status"). This FAQ material is for informational use only; We are explicitly telling you not to take any action based on this document that would break any law.<br>
<br>
Like most consciousness altering substances, <I>Salvia divinorum</I> and salvinorin A can be dangerous if used irresponsibly. If you decide to try this herb, or any preparation containing salvinorin A, it is your responsibility to take proper precautions so that you do not harm yourself or others while under its influence. Neither the authors of this FAQ, nor any individual who contributed to its creation or posting, or who submitted material contained herein, nor the web site host, nor anyone but you yourself is responsible for your actions or their consequences.<br>
<br>
This FAQ is intended to present the facts that are known about <I>Salvia divinorum</I> at this time (the current version date appears at the top of this document). While care has been taken to be as objective as possible, many issues discussed will be controversial and complete objectivity is impossible. Although fairly extensive in its coverage, this FAQ is not comprehensive.<p>

This FAQ is intended for mature, legally-competent adults, willing and able to make their own decisions without blaming others for what they do, or don&#39;t do. It is not written for minors, incompetents, or for any individual who is unable, or unwilling, to take complete legal and moral responsibility for his or her actions. By the act of continuing to read this FAQ you are agreeing that you are a legally competent responsible adult, and that you are willing to take sole responsibility for the consequences of your actions.

</font><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 3"></A>III. SALVIA DIVINORUM BASICS</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3></B><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is <i>Salvia divinorum?</i></FONT></B><br>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is a plant used for its psychoactive effects. Given the right dose, individual, set and setting, it produces a unique state of&nbsp; &#39;divine inebriation&#39; which has been traditionally used by Mazatec healers. This inebriation is quite different from that of alcohol. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is both similar to, and different from, other drugs that affect the brain and behavior. In many ways <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is a unique &#39;magical&#39; herb. Salvia (and the salvinorin it contains) is very difficult to categorize pharmacologically. It does not fit well into any existing pharmacological class. Louis Lewin, the father of psychopharmacology called vision inducing drugs &#39;phantastica&#39;. Let us dust off this venerable term and recycle it by calling <i>Salvia divinorum</i> a &#39;phantasticant&#39;.<br>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does <i>Salvia divinorum</i> have a history of traditional use?</FONT></B><BR>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is used as a sacred medicine by indigenous shamanic 
healers living in the mountainous Sierra Madre Oriental in the northeastern corner of the Mexican State of Oaxaca. In Spanish, these specialized healers are referred to as curanderos; in Mazatec these people are called cho-ta-ci-ne ("one who knows"). <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is primarily used in situations where the curanderos feels it is necessary to travel into the supernatural world in order to discover the true cause of the patient's trouble. It is used in a ceremonial manner to induce a visionary trance state, within which it is possible determine the underlying cause of disease and to learn what steps should be taken to remedy such disease. It is also used in cases of theft or loss to determine the circumstances and whereabouts of missing objects. The leaves are always used fresh and are consumed orally; either by chewing the leaves or drinking an aqueous infusion of the crushed-leaf juices. Sometimes it is given to the patient, sometimes it is taken by the curandero and sometimes both take it together.<BR>
<BR>
Most reports describe the use of this plant by Mazatec shamans, and although it is just barely touched upon in the anthropological literature, it is also reportedly used by their immediately contiguous neighbors, the Cuicatecs and Chinatecs. Given that the plant is quite easily propagated, it is surprising that such an extraordinary herb is only known of in such a geographically limited area. It seems quite probable that it would have found its way to other neighboring tribes through sharing and trade. Perhaps its use is still concealed from the outside world by other groups of indigenous Mexican Indians who still prefer to keep such a sacred plant secret.<BR>
<br><br>


<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 4"></A>IV. OBTAINING SALVIA</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Can I get free salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. We strongly encourage people to grow their own <i>Salvia divinorum</i> plants and to share cuttings with others. Plants are available from a growing number of specialty nurseries. Since it can be propagated easily from a small cutting, you may be able to get a free plant if you know someone already growing it. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is a relatively easy plant to grow. This FAQ provides basic information about growing the plant. To grow and care for one's own plants creates a mutually nurturing relationship, one that engenders a sense of respect for the plant as a living organism. The experience of <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is in part influenced by the circumstances of its acquisition, as well as one's relationship to its source. These factors are important, because they influence the mental framework with which one approaches the experience (i.e. "set"). Growing one's own plants and harvesting the leaves in a respectful manner is particularly meaningful to people who think of the plant as a sacred entity. By growing your own, you will have a constant supply of leaves that can be consumed in the traditional way: fresh, which is one of the safest and most rewarding methods for using this herb.
<br>
<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00"><B>Q.</B> Where can I buy salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A: If you are unable to grow the plant, want to obtain specially prepared extracts, or if you simply want to experiment with <i>Salvia divinorum</i> to see if you like its effects before putting the energy into growing it, you will probably need to purchase it from a commercial supplier. Many people are uncomfortable about the commercialization and exploitation of sacred plants. The profound experiences they afford should not be pushed on to anybody. Too often, vendors sell <i>Salvia divinorum</i> with no information about proper preparation, safety, or effects. To do so is irresponsible. As a consumer, it is important that you trust your supplier and feel comfortable that your money is being spent wisely. <A HREF="salviashop.html"><I>The Sage Wisdom <i>Salvia divinorum</i> Shop</I></A> is a recommended source for <I>Salvia divinorum</I> leaves, standardized extracts, Sage Goddess Emerald Essence, live cuttings, etc. Sales support the <a href="http://sagewisdom.org">Salvia divinorum Research and Information Center</a>, which hosts this FAQ. A detailed listing of other suppliers can be found in: <A HREF="erbook.html">"<i>Salvia divinorum</i> and Salvinorin A: The Best of the Entheogen Review 1992-1998"</A></FONT>. <!--Another good resource is: <A HREF="jonhanna.html">"The Psychedelic Resource List"</A> by Jon Hanna. -->Scores of vendors can be found by typing the term <i>Salvia divinorum,</i> into your favorite Internet search engine.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Do <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves vary in potency?</FONT></B><br>
A: Leaf quality and potency can vary tremendously. When purchasing leaves, it is usually best to purchase the most potent grade of leaf that you can afford. This is especially true if the leaves will be smoked, because the more potent the leaves are, the less smoke you will need to inhale.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is often sold by the ounce. How many dried leaves are in an ounce?</FONT></B><br>
A. This can vary quite a lot. An average, large, mature leaf weighs about 1/3 gram dry. However, a typical harvest of leaves will include leaves of all sizes. A typical ounce usually contains 100 - 200 leaves. It is generally best not to estimate dose by leaf count, but rather by weight.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How many smoked doses are in an ounce of leaf?</FONT></B><br>
A. It varies, depending on the potency of the leaf and the sensitivity of the individual. A person of average sensitivity should be able to achieve moderately strong effects from 1/2 gram of average potency leaf, or 1/4 gram of stronger material, such as "Sierra Mazateca Prime Harvest." To achieve the full effects from a given quantity of leaf, it is very important to use the proper smoking technique.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How many doses are in one ounce of dried <I>Salvia divinorum</I> when using the quid method of ingestion?</FONT></B><br>
A: One ounce should be enough for 4–12 doses, depending on the strength of effects you are after. It is best to rehydrate the leaves with a little water before ingesting them.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is fortified leaf?</FONT></B><br>
A: Fortified leaf is prepared by combining <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves with some form of <i>Salvia divinorum</i> extract. This is also termed <i>extract enhanced leaf.</i> Many people enjoy the effects of smoked <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> However, it can be difficult to achieve a satisfactory level of effects from the leaf in its natural state because of the large quantities of smoke that must be inhaled. Fortified leaves make it possible to achieve effects much more easily. Fortified leaf products allow one to explore deeper levels than are available using plain leaf. This is particularly important for people who find that they are not very sensitive to <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> Another advantage to these products is that they are far easier to consume, since less material needs to be ingested or smoked. Fortified leaf products can be quite powerful and must be used carefully. To reduce the risk of inhaling too large a dose, it is generally best to avoid smoking products containing more than 15 mg salvinorin A per gram of leaf, unless the dose can be weighed precisely.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What are the different forms of fortified leaf?</FONT></B><br>
A: These products fall into the following two categories:<P>

<u>Crude extract enhanced leaf:</u> This is prepared by mixing a tar-like crude extract with <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves. This type of product concentrates tars and other potentially harmful components of the leaf. Crude-extract enhanced leaf is often described by a number followed by an <i>x</i> (such as "5x," "10x," etc). The number indicates the ratio of extract to leaf. For example, "5X" is prepared by mixing one unit of leaf with the tar-like crude extract obtained from four units of leaf. The resulting product is thus five times as potent as the leaves used to produce it. This type of product can vary tremendously in potency because the potency of the leaves used to produce it varies. It has a somewhat sticky feel and inferior burning characteristics due to the impure quality of the extract.<P>

<u>Standardized salvinorin A enhanced leaf:</u> This is prepared by extracting pure salvinorin A (the active principal of the plant), then adding a measured quantity back onto <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves to bring them up to a specific, reliable, and consistent level of potency. This type of product is time consumming to prepare, but is far supperior to crude-extract enhanced leaf. Products that have been prepared in this manner have particularly good burning characteristics because they do not contain the tar-like, gummy impurities found in crude extracts. Since the impurities have been removed during the extraction process, they won't end up in your lungs.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Salvinorin A fortified leaf is often sold by the gram. How many doses are in a gram?</FONT></B><br>
A. This depends on potency of the particular product and the individual's sensitivity. The "regular-strength" offered by <A HREF="salviashop.html">The Sage Wisdom Salvia Shop</A> contains 15 mg of salvinorin A per gram. If you are working with this product, I recommend starting with about 1/20 gram (50 mg). If you find that the effects are too mild for you at this level, then gradually increase the dose until you find the level that works best for you.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How can I measure 1/20 gram (50 mg)?</FONT></B><br> 
A. If you do not have a scale that can measure this quantity, you can simply divide one gram into 20 even parts. First divide the gram into four even piles, then divide each of those into five. It is important that you divide it up as evenly as possible. Either package and store all 20 parts separately (gelatin capsules work great for this), or just keep one part separate to use as a visual reference to estimate the correct amount to use in the future.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How long can I store <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves and salvinorin A fortified leaf without them losing potency?</FONT></B><br>
A. Probably for decades. The active principal, salvinorin A, is quite stable and can be stored at room-temperature. It is probably a good idea to store it in a dark location, such as a drawer or cupboard, so that it is not exposed to the potentially harmful effects of UV light.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Do tinctures of <i>Salvia divinorum</i> require special storage?</FONT></B><br>
A. An ethanolic tincture will retain its potency for many, many years, provided that it is stored in a dark location. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> tinctures are particularly vulnerable to UV light. The salvinorin A in them decomposes fairly quickly when exposed to strong sunlight. Tinctures should be stored at room temperature. They should not be refrigerated because cold temperatures can cause a tar-like sediment to form in the container. Since this sediment contains some of the active principal, the potency of the liquid will be reduced.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Where can I obtain seeds for <I>Salvia divinorum</I>?</FONT></B><br>
A: <I>Salvia divinorum</I> seeds are extremely rare. For reasons not well understood, the plant almost never produces them (even when carefully hand pollinated). You are unlikely to find them offered for sale anywhere. <I>Salvia divinorum</I> seeds have a very low rate of germination and often the seedlings do not survive. Typically, one can expect no more than thirty percent of a batch of seeds to germinate, and only about seventy percent of those that germinate are likely to develop into healthy plants.<BR><BR><BR>



<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 5"></A>V. SALVIA EXPERIENCES AND HOW TO RATE THEM</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is a <i>Salvia divinorum</i> experience like?</FONT></B><br>
A. It is almost certainly not like what you expect. Even if you have considerable experience with other psychoactive drugs, you will find that salvia is significantly different from what you may have encountered before. Salvia is unique, and it is best understood on its own terms, and not by analogy with other substances. Salvia is not a recreational drug, rather, it is best used by those wishing to explore deep meditative states, spiritual realms, mysticism, the nature of consciousness and reality, or the possibilities of shamanistic healing. Experiences vary with the individual, set, and setting as well as with dose and route of administration. It produces a short-lived inebriation that is very different from that of alcohol. However, like alcohol it interferes with the ability to drive, produces incoordination (ataxia), and may produce slurred speech.<p>

The inebriation, at low doses, can facilitate aesthetic and sensual appreciation. However, the experience is not marijuana-like, and salvia is <i>not</i> a marijuana substitute. At somewhat higher doses, visionary trances occur. The lowest level visions consist mainly of closed-eye imagery somewhat similar to the hypnagogic phenomena that many people experience when falling asleep. These tend to be two dimensional faint images. The term "eye candy" is an appropriate description of the interesting closed eye visuals that are not confused with reality. At this level communication with others is still easy and one can move about although clumsiness will occur. With a higher dose vivid visual images occur even with eyes open, and with eyes closed one may completely enter the visionary world, and it will seem quite real, but upon opening ones eyes one will reestablish contact with ones surroundings. Speech patterns may be interfered with and communication is difficult. At still higher doses, one remains conscious but completely enters an inner realm and loses all contact with ones actual surroundings. Some people may move around in this deep trance state and for this reason a sitter is required for anyone seeking to explore such deep levels. With very high dosage a brief period of unconsciousness or at least the inability to subsequently remember the experience will occur. It is useful to have a scale to describe salvia experiences. One such rating scale is based on the mnemonic S-A-L-V-I-A.

<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Maybe the scale can help me know what to expect. What&#39;s the scale?</FONT></B><br>
A. The scale describes six different levels of effects, each one more intense than the previous. The overall intensity of a salvia experience is scored according to the highest scale level attained during the course of the experience.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="4"><B>The SALVIA Experiential Rating Scale</B></FONT></CENTER><br>
Level -1 "S stands for SUBTLE effects." A feeling that "something" is happening, although it is difficulty to say just what. Relaxation and increased sensual appreciation may be noted. This mild level is useful for meditation and may facilitate sexual pleasure.<p>

Level - 2 "A stands for ALTERED perception." Colors and textures are paid attention to. Appreciation of music may be enhanced. Space may appear of greater or lesser depth than is usual. But visions do not occur at this level. Thinking becomes less logical, and more playful; short term memory difficulties are may be noted.<p>

Level - 3 "L" stands for LIGHT visionary state." Closed eye visuals (clear imagery with eyes closed: fractal patterns, vinelike and geometric patterns, visions of objects and designs). The imagery is often two dimensional. If open eyed visual effects occur these are usually vague and fleeting. At this level phenomena similar to the hypnagogic phenomena that some people experience at sleep onset occur. At this level visions are experienced as "eye candy" but are not confused with reality.<p>

Level - 4 "V stands for VIVID visionary state." Complex three dimensional realistic appearing scenes occur. Sometimes voices may be heard. With eyes open contact with consensual reality will not be entirely lost, but when you close your eyes you may forget about consensus reality and enter completely into a dreamlike scene. Shamanistic journeying to other lands, foreign or imaginary; encounters with beings, entities, spirits; or travels to other ages may occur. You may even live the life of another person. At this level you have entered the shaman's world. Or if you prefer you are in "dream time." With eyes closed you experience fantasies (dream like happenings, with a story line to them). So long as your eyes are closed you may believe they are really occurring. This differs from the "eye candy" closed eye imagery, of level 3.<p>

Level - 5 "I" stands for IMMATERIAL existence." At this level consciousness remains and some thought processes are still lucid, but one becomes completely involved in inner experience and loses all contact with consensual reality. Individuality may be lost; one experiences merging with God/dess, mind, universal consciousness, or bizarre fusions with other objects real or imagined, e.g. merging with a wall may be experienced. At this level it is impossible to function in consensual reality, but unfortunately some people do not remain still but move around in this befuddled state. For this reason a sitter is essential to ensure the safety of someone voyaging to the inner levels. To the person experiencing this, the phenomenon may be terrifying or exceedingly pleasant; but to an outside observer the individual may appear confused or disoriented.<p>

Level 6 - "A stands for AMNESIC effects " At this stage either consciousness is lost; or at least one is unable to later recall what one is experiencing. The individual may fall, or remain immobile or thrash around; somnambulistic behavior may occur; injuries can be sustained without pain being felt; on awakening the individual will have no recollection of what he/she did, experienced or said in level 6. People cannot ever recall what they experience in this very deep trance state. This is not a sought after level as later nothing can be recalled of the experience.
<br>
<br>
<!--<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Do salvia users use any special words to describe the experience?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. Members of the <i>Salvia email list</i> have contributed numerous salvia vocabulary suggestions. A few of the more accessible words and phrases submitted were: accepting, afterglow, besaged, dissociadelic, dream people, endoreality, fantasia, floating, goofy, healing, magic casements, mind tunnels, sound of silence, strange attractor, teacher, transdimensional, visions, weird, and wisdom.<br><br>-->

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the salvia afterglow?</FONT></B><br>
A. There are two kinds of afterglow effects: immediate and persisting.
The immediate afterglow probably is due to the residual pharmacological 
effects of salvinorin A (some of which is presumably still present in 
the body for about an hour
or longer after the primary effects have subsided). This immediate 
afterglow is often described as a vague sense of peaceful euphoria lasting 
an hour (or a bit longer) after the obvious intoxication has worn off.<P>

What is more interesting is that a surprisingly large proportion of 
salvia users report a second type of afterglow, the persisting type. It 
typically involves mood elevation, an overall sense of well being, and 
often a fresh outlook on life which can linger for several days (or 
longer) after the experience.  This phenomenon seems to be quite common. 
For example, in a small online poll every one of the eleven poll 
respondents reported experiencing an afterglow. Three people reported it 
lasted one day or less (this probably represented the immediate type of 
afterglow discussed above). But six reported mood elevation lasting 
between one and three days. And two respondents reported mood elevation 
lasting beyond three days.<P>

Differing hypotheses have been advanced to account for the persisting  
type of afterglow. It may represent a  phase in which the person is 
psychologically integrating the experience. Alternatively it may have an 
as yet unknown neuropharmacological explanation. Those who think of the 
salvia experience in religious, spiritual, or mystical terms may speak 
of such things as enlightenment, satori, and "cleansing the doors of 
perception." Psychological, physical and spiritual explanations are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive.<P>

In a published case report a clinically significant antidepressant 
effect of low dose salvia (chewed and held in the mouth) was reported 
for a single patient. The patient  intentionally used the afterglow 
phenomenon for self treatment. Although we are aware of a few other 
anecdotal reports suggesting that salvia may be useful to some depressed 
people, at this time <i>no</i> claim can be made that  salvia is a generally 
safe and effective treatment for people who are clinically depressed. 
Perhaps mental health professionals ought to systematically investigate 
this question.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Could you show me an actual experiential report?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. Many experiential reports are archived at: <a href="experiences.html">http://sagewisdom.org/experiences.html</a> The following is one person's report of a first meeting with Lady Salvia. It was written by Greendrag who has given permission for its inclusion here in this FAQ.<br>

The Experience: I felt like I was in a scene from my childhood, almost as if I
had smoked salvia as a child and was feeling something in the present.
I felt (note, I didn&#39;t see any of this, it was purely a feeling) like I
was eight years old, in a park around my house in a swing during the middle
of a summer day.&nbsp; After I got this feeling, the feeling of the park
transformed into where I was: the beach at present age.&nbsp; I then began
to see (through closed eyelids) what looked like a ranch in Mexico.&nbsp; I
then "felt" that I was in the desert southwest, looking into this
ranch.&nbsp; Through closed eyelids, I saw the beach I was on, but then a few
yards away, the beach sand ended and the ranch/desert began.&nbsp; In the
ranch, I thought I saw a beautiful Mexican lady.
I then felt I was on an Indian reservation, with some Indians.&nbsp; I felt
the feeling of the <i>peyoteros.</i> I then felt the
ranch/desert/reservation drift away, not in a normal fashion, but around
my body in a 360 degree turn around my body.&nbsp; I felt a closeness
with the aura of it all. I then felt
&quot;normal&quot; again and lied there still for a few moments, with my eyes
closed.&nbsp; M had wondered off and I heard him in the distance. I then
heard footsteps come behind the umbrellas, and then around them.&nbsp; I felt
the presence of some old, yet beautiful man (could have been a woman)
sprinkle some dust on me.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t feel the dust, but I felt something
mentally.&nbsp; I then opened my eyes. I felt exactly like what happened to Jodie Foster in the movie <i>Contact,</i> as she crashed onto the beach after being transported in that machine.&nbsp; Also, the scene afterward where she comes back to earth, yet still feeling she was on that beach.<br>
<br>
I sat up and walked off to the edge of the beach.&nbsp; I was left with a
sort of knowingness.&nbsp; I realized many things at this point. I would call <i>this</i> the best part of the experience. Salvia is definitely a &quot;teacher&quot; plant.&nbsp; I now look upon her very seriously and with the utmost respect.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 6"></A>VI. METHODS OF USE</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How is salvia used? What are the methods and how do they differ?</FONT></B><br>
A. There are several different methods of using Salvia: These are
discussed below under the questions about smoking, oral, and other
methods.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Okay, tell me about smoking.</FONT></B><br>
A. Smoking is probably the most common method for &#39;Western&#39; users. Dried
salvia leaf is readily available from commercial sources and can be
smoked without further preparation in tobacco pipes, joints, or
water-pipes or bongs. Salvia must be smoked hot (hotter than tobacco is)
in order for salvinorin to be vaporized. The smoke is inhaled fast and
hot, deeply into the lungs. Several hits in quick succession are usually
required. The smoke is irritating and probably has the same sort of
health risks as tobacco smoke - cancer, bronchitis, emphysema, and heart
and blood vessel disease. When smoking it is a good idea to have a
sitter present although many smokers do not take this advice.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the usual dose?</FONT></B><br>
A. One or two large crushed leaves (¼–½ gram). Individual requirements will vary.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How strong is smoking?</FONT></B><br>
A. It varies greatly depending on the dose.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How long does the experience last?</FONT></B><br>
A. When smoked, the first effects are noticed within 1 minute, rapidly
developing to a peak which lasts 5 - 10 minutes, then gradually
diminishing over the next 20 - 30 minutes. From beginning to end, the
entire experience lasts 30 minutes to one hour. Best not to drive for at
least several more hours - just in case your reflexes or judgement are
impaired longer than you think they might be.<br>
<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is there any special trick to smoking <I>Salvia divinorum</I>?</FONT></B><br>
A. Please read <A HREF="smokeadvice.html">"How to achieve effects from smoked
<i>Salvia divinorum</i>"</A>. It is best to smoke the leaf material in a pipe (not a cigarette). Salvinorin A has a relatively high vaporization temperature, and with a pipe you can draw a flame directly onto the leaf material so that it burns quite hot. It is very important to hold the smoke deeply in the lungs for a good 20 - 30 seconds before exhaling. This allows time for salvinorin A to be absorbed from the smoke. If one exhales to quickly, much of the material will be wasted. The level of effects you achieve depends on the amount of smoke inhaled and absorbed within about a 2 minute period. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to take 3 big hits (holding each one in for 20 - 30 seconds). The body metabolizes salvinorin A quite rapidly, so if you want to increase the effect by smoking several hits, you need to ingest the smoke faster than it is metabolized. If you pause too long between hits, the duration will be extended, but the intensity of effects won't increase.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How do I smoke salvinorin A fortified leaf?</FONT></B><br>
A. The standardized salvinorin A enhanced leaf is very easy to use. Place the amount that you intend to use in the bowl of a small pipe. Since the leaf may be very finely crumbled, the pipe should be fitted with a fine-mesh screen in the bottom of the bowl to prevent small particals from getting into the pipe-stem and being inhaled. When you are ready, first take a deep breath of fresh air, then exhale to empty your lungs, then immediately apply a flame to the leaf material and inhale the whole dose of smoke in one lungfull. It is important to hold the lighter flame immediatly above the material and to draw it down into the leaves as you inhale. The leaf must be heated to a relatively high temperature in order to vaporize the active principal. As long as the flame is drawn down into the leaf, it will burn the leaves at a high enough temperature.  It is very important to hold the smoke deeply in your lungs for a good 20–30 seconds before exhaling. It takes time for salvinorin A to condense out of the smoke and be absorbed by the lungs. If you exhale too soon much of it will be wasted.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Do I need a special kind of lighter to smoke salvinorin A fortified leaf or <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves?</FONT></B><br>
A. An ordinary lighter or match is quite hot enough to vaporize salvinorin A and should be quite adequate for smoking salvinorin A fortified leaf products. An extra hot flame, such as that produced by a micro-torch, will simply cause more rapid vaporization and combustion. This can be an advantage when smoking plain <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaves, because it is usually necessary to smoke a relatively large amount of leaf in a short amount time to achieve strong effects.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Can the standardized salvinorin A fortified leaf products be taken orally/sublingually?</FONT></B><br>
A: In theory, yes, but since sublingual absorption in not very efficient in this form, you would need to use a dose about 30–40 times larger than the smoking dose. From an economic point of view, it makes far more sense to use Sage Goddess Emerald Essence for sublingual use. Save the standardized salvinorin A fortified leaf for smoking, since the primary benefit of the standardized extracts is that they substantially reduce the amount of smoke one needs to ingest.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is it true that it requires several attempts, before one begins to experience the full effects of Salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A: Many people report that they became more sensitive to the effects of salvia after they had tried it several times. Apparently it may take a few exposures before one becomes fully sensitized to Salvia's effects. I don't know why this should be the case, but I've heard it from so many people that am convinced this is a real phenomenon.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. I've followed all the advice, but I don't seem to be able to achieve strong effects, why is this?</FONT></B><br>
A. Approximately 10% of people are unusually insensitive to salvinorin A. Most of these people can achieve a satisfactory level of effects by using a higher than average dose. Some people require a dose several times higher than average. Be very cautious when experimenting with higher than average doses. Doses should be increased in gradual increments until one find the level of effects that interests you.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is there any way to extend the duration of the effects of smoked <I>Salvia divinorum</I>?</FONT></B><br>
A: salvinorin A does not produce a tolerance effect, so you can extend the experience by simply smoking more as soon as the effects begin to fade. You can also ease into the experience by starting with a small dose and following it immediately with a "booster" dose.<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is vaporization and how does it differ from smoking?</FONT></B><br>
A. Vaporization consists of heating pure salvinorin A, extract, or
powdered leaf to a high temperature without igniting it. The temperature
must be high enough for at least some of the salvinorin to temporarily
become a gas (vapor). The ideal air-stream temperature for vaporization is approximately 277° C (530° F.). These vapors, mixed with the aerosol the vapors condense to and air, are inhaled. Like the smoke from burning salvia
leaves, the products of vaporization contain salvinorin and other
volatile products, either as gases, or as an aerosol of small condensed
droplets. Unlike smoking, vaporization does not produce ash particulates,
or oxidation products such as carbon monoxide. Inhaling vapors is
probably somewhat less damaging to one&#39;s lungs than is inhaling smoke;
but it cannot be considered free of all health risks. Your lungs evolved
to inhale clean air, not hot vapors.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How is vaporization done?</FONT></B><br>
A. There are not yet commercial vaporizers optimized for smoking Salvia.
Salvia leaf, extract, or salvinorin can be vaporized on heated aluminum
foil and inhaled with a straw. Alternatively,&nbsp; homemade vaporizer units
can be constructed, or units designed for consumption of cannabis or
tobacco can be used. Many commercial units are either not hot enough
(won&#39;t vaporize) or too hot (will carbonize) for optimum vaporization of
salvinorin.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is vaporization strong?</FONT></B><br>
A. Of course it depends on the dose, but it can be unbelievably strong! Dangerously so! Since very little smoke is produced with this technique, it is possible to inhale a very large dose with very little effort. At large doses, one may temporarily lose all awareness of who one is, where one is or what one is doing. Falls, fires, injuries etc. can easily occur. If you will be vaporizing
it is <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL</FONT> that a sitter be present to protect you from
injury.<br>
<!--<br><B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How far can one go on vaporization?</FONT></B><br>
A. Level 6. You can pass out.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. So vaporized crude leaf powder can take you as far as pure salvinorin can?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. To the point of general anesthesia.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How long do vaporizer trips last?</FONT></B><br>
A. Usually less than 1/2 hour.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How quickly do they take effect?</FONT></B><br>
A. Within seconds of inhaling a lung full of vapor. The first few
inhalations often contain no salvinorin as the unit is not yet hot
enough. Once salvinorin is inhaled you have only seconds to lie down in
a safe place before you become incapacitated!<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is vaporization a good way to go?</FONT></B><br>
A. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">NO!</FONT> Definitely not with present day vaporizer designs. Perhaps in the
future a vaporizer will be designed specifically for salvia use which
consistently delivers just the dose one is seeking. But using present
day designs one goes too far, too fast. Injuries and fires can easily
occur. There&#39;s nothing desirable about passing out. Instead of being
able to linger at the interesting moderate trip levels of 3 and 4, you
are blasted into a maximum intensity trip for which you will have little
subsequent memory, and then it&#39;s all over. If you want to get completely
smashed instantly vaporization will achieve that, but if you want a
dialog with a &#39;teacher plant&#39;, just smoke leaves, or better yet take
salvia orally.<br>-->
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How about oral use?</FONT></B><br>
A. Oral use by means of chewed and swallowed leaves, or by means of a water-based salvia
drink are the traditional methods of use by the Mazatec healers. These
methods have much to recommend them including safety and suitability for
learning from the &#39;teacher plant&#39;. When salvia leaves are chewed and
held in ones mouth a long time, salvinorin is absorbed directly by the
tissues lining the mouth. Swallowed salvia is much less effective,
although the traditional Mazatec water-based drink, which is swallowed,
is effective if enough leaves are used in its preparation.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does oral salvia work as fast as smoking?</FONT></B><br>
A. Definitely not. When ingested orally, the first effects begin in 10
-20 minutes. The effects build to a peak fairly quickly, reaching a
plateau which can last anywhere from 30 minutes to one and a half hours.
The effects then gradually subside over an additional 30 minutes to one
and a half hours. From beginning to end, the entire experience can last
anywhere from one to three hours. Best not to drive for at least several
more hours - just in case your reflexes or judgement are impaired longer
than you think they might be.<br>
<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What method of ingestion produces the best effects: Smoked or oral?</FONT></B><br>
A: Different people have different preferences. You should experiment with both methods and find your own preference. Smoking provides a relatively short, but potentially very intense experience, whereas sublingual absorption provides a substantially longer lasting and somewhat more gentle experience.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the quid method?</FONT></B><br>
A. A quid is a rolled up cylinder of fresh leaves. The quid method
traditionally uses fresh salvia leaves, large ones if available.
Rehydrated previously dried leaves can be used if fresh ones are
unavailable; there seems to be little loss of strength due to drying and
rehydration. The quid method produces effects that begin more gradually and last longer than is the case with smoking. Unlike smoking, the quid
method does not damage lungs. Unfortunately the quid method does not work for everyone. And some people find the bitter taste of the leaves unpleasant.<br>
<br>
The following is a recipe for using a large dose of leaves by the quid
method. It can produce strong effects in sensitive individuals.<br>
<br>
Note: This recipe calls for 16 leaves which is a large dose. A smaller
dose would be safer for novices, using fewer leaves is especially
important if exceptionally strong leaves are being used.<br>
<br>
Method: Make two quids of about 8 leaves each.&nbsp; Chew the first quid for
15 minutes, chewing once every 5 to 10 seconds. Keep the quid under your
tongue between chews as this maximizes sublingual absorption . Swish the
saliva around your mouth from time to time. Do not swallow or spit
unless necessary. After 15 minutes of chewing, spit out the remains of
the first quid . Now, if you are not already as high as you want to get,
begin the second quid. Chew this exactly like the first for 15 minutes.
When that 15 minutes have gone, spit out the quid. Of course if you feel
you have reached the level you want, just spit out the quid before you
get higher than you want to. A few minutes after you spit out the quid
you will start coming down. During quid chewing, have a bowl handy for
spitting into. Make sure it is a bowl that wont tip over, as you will
get pretty uncoordinated! Keep a towel handy in case you drool. The
taste of chewed leaves is unpleasantly bitter but most people won&#39;t
vomit. However, keep that bowl handy!<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is there a safe way of increasing the effect of chewed quid?</FONT></B><br>
A. The effect of chewed quid can apparently be potentiated just by using
mouthwash! Do not add the mouthwash to the leaves. Instead, just before
putting the quid in your mouth, rinse your entire mouth out thoroughly
(for at least 30 seconds) with a mouthwash that contains both menthol
and alcohol. Cool Mint Listerine® works well. This will noticeably
increase the effect of chewed leaves. This effect makes pharmacological
sense, as it is known that a mixture of alcohol, water, and menthol
increases the permeability of mucous membranes to various drugs.
Presumably it is increasing the rate of salvinorin absorption. It is
possible that other ingredients in the mouthwash, such as eucalyptol may
also be contributing to this effect. Another technique, which may be helpful, is to lightly brush the interior surfaces of the mouth with a toothbrush. This removes a layer of dead cells and consequently seems to improve absorption. If you will also be using the mouthwash technique, it is probably best to do the brushing first.<br><br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is salvia honey slurry?</FONT></B><br>
A. Recipe for Salvia honey slurry: Ingredients: 5 grams of finely
powdered dried salvia leaf; 1 tsp. McCormick Peppermint extract (80&#37;
alcohol); 4 tsp. honey that was first warmed in a microwave oven.
Preparation: the leaf powder is put into a teacup, add the peppermint
extract, then the honey. Mix until a uniform slurry is formed. Use: lie
down on a couch or on the floor on pillows, dim the lights, and slowly
spoon the mixture into your mouth, one spoonful at a time; get it under
your tongue and in contact with the entire lining of your mouth. When
your mouth becomes full of saliva swallow and spoon in the next spoonful
of honey slurry. Over a 30 minute period slowly consume all the honey,
keeping it in contact with your oral mucosa as long as possible. Expect
a mild gentle experience, not a very strong one.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What&#39;s a sublingual extract?</FONT></B><br>
A. These are extracts designed for sublingual absorption. The are held beneath the tongue so that the active principal is absorbed into the sublingual mucosa and from there into the bloodstream. The duration and quality of the experience produced is equivalent to chewing fresh leaves using the quid method. One type of extract that may be used in this manner is called a "soft extract." Soft extracts are tar-like in texture; they are effective for sublingual use, but very large amounts must be used because they are not absorbed very efficiently. More information about soft extracts is available in section XIII <A HREF="#Section 13">Processing plant material</A>. Various liquid extracts are also effective for sublingual use. "Sage Goddess Emerald Essence" is a particularly effective, ultra-concentrated, refined tincture that is prepared using a unique separation process developed by Daniel Siebert. This product is one of the most effective and reliable forms of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> for oral use. It is available from <A HREF="salviashop.html">The Sage Wisdom Salvia Shop</A>.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is salvia elixir?</FONT></B><br>
A. A sweetened aromatic alcohol water extraction of salvia leaf. It is
held&nbsp; in the mouth for 1/2 hour to allow salvinorin to be absorbed<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How is it made and used?</FONT></B><br>
A. Recipe for salvia peppermint elixir: Note: this extraction uses
whiskey, rum, or vodka. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DO NOT USE POISONOUS DENATURED ALCOHOL.</FONT>
Ingredients and method: powdered salvia leaf (all you can spare) in a
quart Mason jar. Barely cover the powder with whisky, vodka, or rum, the
higher the proof the better. Close the jar. Shake every 15 minutes for 2
hours minimum. (For stronger elixir let it sit in contact with the leaf
powder for days.) Pour off the salvia / whiskey mixture, filtering it
through a fine mesh spice bag (the type chefs use for Bouquet garni).
Squeeze the wet powder through the bag, saving as much of the salvia
saturated whiskey as possible. The whiskey (which is chemically a
mixture of ethanol and water) has extracted the salvinorin A, so you now
have an extract containing salvinorin. Add 1 capful of McCormick&#39;s
Peppermint Extract (to make the brew both more palatable and more
potent) to 1 oz. of the salvia extract. What you now have is an
ethanol/water/menthol/salvinorin delivery system. The menthol in the
peppermint extract probably helps transport salvinorin across the oral
mucosa, thereby maximizing the amount of Salvinorin that enters your
blood stream. Sweeten with a little honey or sugar. You will need to
dilute the elixir with an equal volume of water just prior to use in
order to avoid mouth irritation. To use, hold in your mouth and swish it
around for 30 minutes. Hold as much in your mouth as you comfortably can
(about 2 oz.)<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Will cooked salvia have any effect?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. For some people, but usually the effect will be quite mild, only just above threshold level. Here is a report of an experiment and&nbsp; recipe
that provided&nbsp; a pleasant mild experience (level 2 to level 3 on the
SALVIA scale.<P>

Materials:<br>
<br>
• 4 freshly picked very large leaves from good plants were cut into
strips. The leaf material weighted 9.92 G.<br>
• 4 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br>
• 1 large clove of garlic , coarsely sliced<br>
• 1 tsp. soy sauce<br>
• a small piece of frozen ginger root (about 2 cm. wide and 1/2 cm.
long)<br>
• a pinch of ground chili pepper<br><br>
Preparation: The cut up leaves were
mixed with the sliced clove of garlic and the extra virgin olive oil and
this mixture was stir fried in a wok-style fry pan. The pan had a Teflon
lining and stir frying was done with wooden spoons (thus the leaves were
not in contact with metal while being fried (it is not known if this
makes a difference). The mixture was stir fried until the garlic slices
turned medium brown darker than golden brown but definitely not
charred).&nbsp; Once the garlic had turned brown the leaves, garlic and the
oil in which the mixture had been fried were all transferred to the
refrigerator for later consumption. Note: the time the leaves spent
sitting in the oil in the refrigerator may have aided salvinorin
extraction into the oil phase.&nbsp; Several hours later the bowl was taken
out of the refrigerator, the frozen ginger root was grated onto it and a
pinch of chili powder and 1 tsp. of soy sauce were added for
flavoring. These were mixed and the entire contents of the bowl,
including all the oil was eaten (not kept under the tongue like a chewed
salvia quid but rather eaten like any food would be).&nbsp; The saut&eacute; was
consumed on an empty stomach (which may have been necessary for its
rapid absorption).&nbsp; A repeat of this experiment during which the fried
leaves were not refrigerated prior to consumption yielded only minimal
effects (level 1 to 2) for one individual and no effects for a second person.
There have been other reports of both success and failure from sauteed
Salvia. It is possible that one reason not everyone is successful in
obtaining a salvia effect from the saut&eacute; may be differences in leaf
potency. With weaker leaves&nbsp; a higher dose would be required. If you try
this, eat all the oil the leaves were fried in along with the leaves, as
the oil probably contains much of the salvinorin.&nbsp; Probably the best
results (assuming average quality leaves eaten by an individual with
average sensitivity to Salvia) would be obtained with a dose of about 15
to 20 grams of fresh leaves saut&eacute;ed as described&nbsp; Comments: The effects I
experienced the first time was level 2 to 3 and the second time level 1
to 2. The recommendation to increase the leaf dosage was made in the
interest of being able to achieve a somewhat higher level for myself and
a discernible level for someone less sensitive to salvia than I am. I
believe I am more sensitive to salvia than about 2/3 of people.<br>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 7"></A>VII. THE PLANT AND ITS CARE</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What type of plant is <i>Salvia divinorum?</i></FONT></B><br>
A. Salvia divinorum is a type of sage. Generally, sages belong to the
genus Salvia. There are about 900 different Salvia&nbsp; species, including
many ornamental garden sages and <i>Salvia officinalis,</i> the common cooking
sage. <i>Salvia</i> is a genus in the mint family&nbsp; (Lamiaceae) <i>Salvia divinorum</i>
is literally the sage (Salvia) of the diviners (divinorum). The plant
has a characteristic weak &#39;mousy-but-minty&#39;&nbsp; aroma. It is a native of a small area in Oaxaca, Mexico, growing in mountainous lands where the
Mazatec Indian people dwell.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How does the plant grow?</FONT></B><br>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is a semi-tropical perennial. That means that it can
grow back year after year but only if it is not exposed to frost. It is
a&nbsp; green plant with large leaves and a distinctive thick hollow square
green stem. It can grow several meters high if conditions are
favorable.&nbsp; When it grows high enough the branches will bend or break
and may root if they come in contact with moist earth. Although S.
divinorum&nbsp; can flower under natural lighting conditions (it has white
flowers with purplish calyces), it only rarely sets seed, even when
carefully hand-pollinated, and when it does the seeds are not very
fertile. Experience has shown that plants grown from seed are often
lacking in vigor. The&nbsp; plant is typically propagated by cuttings. The
leaves are oval, weakly serrated and can be quite large (up to 9 inches
length). The leaves are often emerald green and are covered with a fine
coating of very short hairs giving the leaves a satin-like velvety
appearance in certain lights. The plants are water loving but grow best
in partial shade in well-watered but well-drained soil.<br>

<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is it easy to grow Salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. Salvia can be grown indoors in any climate. It makes a beautiful
house plant.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Can I grow it outdoors?</FONT></B><br>
A. That depends on where you live. If you live in a humid semi-tropical
climate, with well-drained but well-watered somewhat acidic soil with a
high humus content, salvia will thrive. If you live in a more northern
(or arid) climate you can still grow salvia outdoors, weather
permitting, but you may have to do it with some care, making sure it is
protected from frost, watered frequently, and misted as needed when low
humidity conditions prevail. Salvia will not tolerate frost or drought.
It can be grown outdoors in pots which can be brought indoors when it is
cold (below 40 degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How often should it be watered?</FONT></B><br>
A. Often. Salvia will tell you when it is getting too dry - its leaves
will droop. Be sure to water it at the first sign of mild drooping, do
not let the plant become flaccid. The soil should drain but should be
kept moist.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What soil mixture should I use?</FONT></B><br>
A. Most commercial potting soils work quite well. Make sure the pot is large and that it has drainage holes in the bottom.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does it need fertilizer?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes it will. There is no one fertilizer that is clearly
best. Satisfactory results can be achieved with different products. Some
of them are: Scott's All-Purpose Plant Food 18-13-13 lightly sprinkled on
the soil about once every six weeks; fish emulsion (but this is not for
indoor use as it stinks); Miracle-Gro added to the water once a week (1/4
tsp. per gallon); Peters Professional Soluble Plant Food (15-30-15) 1/4
tsp. to gallon of water once per week. Despite what used to be believed, Salvia does not require acidic soil conditions. There is no need to use fertilizers designed for "acid-loving" plants unless lime buildup is a problem.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How much sunlight is needed?</FONT></B><br>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> can do well in a variety of different lighting
conditions. It does best with a few hours of partial sunlight a day. It
can do well grown indoors near a window. It can survive full sun if kept
well watered and misted frequently. It can also handle moderately deep
shade.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What pests are a problem?</FONT></B><br>
A. Too many! Whitefly is a big problem for greenhouse grown plants.
Aphids, slugs, caterpillars, thrips, spider mites, and scale insects can also
damage your plants. Root rot and stem rot can be problems. Fungal spots
can appear in leaves. It is not known which plant viruses attack <i>Salvia
divinorum</i> but many attack other sages.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the best way to deal with pests?</FONT></B><br>
A. Your garden hose is your best friend in fighting pests. Spray the leaves hard enough to blow the pests away but not hard enough to damage the leaves. Don't forget to spray the undersides of the leaves too. If the hose method does not do the trick then more specific methods will be needed. Aphids and scale insects can be removed with a cotton swab dipped in
isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Slugs can be kept away by growing in pots
on a raised deck or palette. Beer can also be used to attract and drown
slugs. Set a saucer of beer in a slight depression in the ground; the
surface of the saucer should be flush with the soil so slugs can get in. Slugs and snail are said to be repelled by copper surfaces. Copper foil strips can be placed as a protective barrier on the soil surface around plants. Keep them a distance away from the plants. Do not let the copper touch the plants as it may kill them. Snail pellets (effective against both snails and slugs) are available from garden stores. They are poisonous. Spider mites can be controlled by dissolving Castile soap in water and spraying the leaves, including the underside. Repeat at two week
intervals for three applications. Caution: there have been reports of
soap damaging leaves. Using a garden hose outdoors, or a mister indoors,
to spray both tops and bottoms of the leaves may be able to control
spider mites without using soap.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How can I propagate Salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is propagated by cuttings, not by seed (except very
rarely).&nbsp; Cuttings must be rooted either in water or directly in soil.
Here&#39;s how:<br><br>
1. Rooting in water: Salvia can be rooted simply much like the common
ornamental Coleus (they are closely related). Cut off a branch (4 to 8
inches long) bearing some leaves. Immediately place it in about 1.5
inches of water in a small water glass. Only one cutting is to be put in
each glass, so if rot develops in one cutting it cannot spread to
another.<br><br>

It is best if the branch is cut back to just below a node since nodes
are the places from which new roots are most likely to develop. While it
is not necessary to cut make the cut here, doing so has the advantage
that there will be no stem material dangling in the water below the
node. This is important as the cut stem end is more likely to start to
rot than is a node.<br><br>

Make sure the cutting is made with clean shears or knife so the cut stem
does not get attacked by microorganisms that cause stem rot. Cut off all
the large leaves, but leave a few small leaves. Place a clear glass jar
(or clear plastic bag) upside down over the plant to serve as a
humidity tent. Place where it will get some sunlight. Change the water
daily. It may be a good idea to use cooled boiled water. If your water
is chlorinated boiling will drive off chlorine. Non-chlorinated water
may be contaminated with plant pathogens, but boiling should kill these.
Rooting in water this way is successful about 3/4 of the time (the rest
of the time stem rot occurs and kills the cutting).<br><br>

In two weeks roots will start to develop. When they are about 1/2 to 1
inch long transplant to potting soil in a well-drained pot. Continue to
cover with a clear glass jar or clear plastic bag to serve as a humidity
tent until the plant appears vigorous.
<br>
<br>
2. Rooting in Soil: Salvia can be rooted directly in soil. This method,
a modification of the one posted to the list by Todd Pisek, works quite
well. Materials needed: potting soil, two disposable plastic cups, some
Rootone powder (this is a rooting hormone mixture that also contains a
fungicide and is available at any nursery), a 1 gallon Baggie™ brand
storage bag, and a rubber band. Have water handy. Method: Punch some
small holes in one of the cups for drainage. Fill the cup 1/3 the way up
with potting soil. Fill the cup another 1/3 with soil. Using a pencil or
a finger make a hole in the soil about 2 inches deep. The soil is now
ready for your cutting. You must now prepare the cutting. With a clean
shears cut off a length of stem from a healthy plant. Leave a few leaves
(small ones) on top. Harvest the larger leaves from the cut-off stem.
Immediately after cutting the stem, place it in clean water. Cut it back
to just below a node, as roots will develop from the node. Keep the cut
surface wet. Place the cut surface at about 1 inch above the cut into
rooting powder. Shake off the excess. Rooting powder is somewhat toxic,
so wash your hands after handling it. Place the powder-coated cutting in
the hole in the soil. Gently push the soil around the cutting, holding
it in place and filling in the hole. Water the planted cutting until
some water runs out the drainage holes. Place the cup with the plant in
it into the second plastic cup (which is there to catch any runoff
water). You may want to put a small piece of wood or plastic in the
outer cup to act as a spacer thereby allowing enough space for excess
water to drain. Place a 1 gallon clear plastic bag over the rooted
cutting, using a rubber band to hold it in place. The rubber band should
be outside the bag and the bag outside both cups. The Rubber band holds
the bag against the cups. As the plastic bag acts to conserve moisture
frequent watering is not required. After several weeks you can
transplant the now-rooted plant to a larger pot.

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Are there other psychopharmacologically active salvia species?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes. It appears&nbsp; that number of different salvia species have
different forms of psychoactivity. In addition some other members of
the&nbsp; mint family&nbsp; (to which genus <i>Salvia</i> belongs) are psychoactive
(&#39;psychoactive&#39; means that a substance effects mood, alertness,
thinking, emotion, or perception, most psychoactive substances are not
hallucinogenic), for example there is a Central Asian mint&nbsp; known as
&#39;intoxicating mint&#39;&nbsp; (Lagochiles inebriens)&nbsp; whose leaves are
reportedly&nbsp; toasted and then brewed into a sedative tea.<br><br>
• There is an unclassified salvia species&nbsp; called &quot;Xiwit&quot; by the Nahuatl<br>
people of Sierra de Puebla, who use it as a dream inducer. It
apparently is not S. divinorum.<br><br>
• The many strains of the common cooking sage&nbsp; S. officinalis contain
thujone which (along with alcohol) is the main ingredient that gives
absinthe its characteristic psychoactivity. Thujone (also found in
wormwood and juniper) is believed by some to cause brain damage.&nbsp; Best
to use cooking sage as a condiment --- but not as a drug.<br><br>
• Another quite different salvia species of great interest is S. splendens, frequently grown for its showy flowers. Claude Rifat and Kevin Brunelle were the first to post on its alleged psychoactivity. Other list members subsequently reported psychoactivity of a tranquilizing or sedative type if it is either smoked or taken by the chewed/sublingual route. Both leaves and flowers have been reported to exhibit this tranquilizing activity. However its purported psychoactivity has been called into question and may turn out to be an example of placebo effect. A double blind placebo controlled study of S. splendens was conducted by Daniel Siebert using as subjects volunteers from the Salvia email list. Analysis of the results indicated there was no statistically significant difference between the mental effects of the placebo herb (Viola odorata) and of S. splendens.  This held true regardless of whether the herbs were taken sublingually, or smoked. Although "lack of evidence of difference" is NOT the same as "evidence of lack of difference," at this point, the burden of scientific proof is on anyone claiming that S splendens is more psychoactive than placebo.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 9"></A>IX. SALVIA AS AN ENTHEOGEN</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. I have seen salvia referred to as an &#39;entheogen&#39;. What&#39;s that?</FONT></B><br>
A. The word comes from the Greek, loosely translated as &quot;making possible
(contact with) the divine within (oneself)&quot;. Drugs (and drug plants)
which can transport their user to mystical states of consciousness are
often called entheogens.. More properly entheogen refers to a type of
drug usage, not a type of drug. Salvia CAN be used as an entheogen. It
is used as such when taken as part of a serious spiritual quest; but
most &#39;Western&#39; salvia usage would not qualify as entheogenic. The issue
of the spiritual/religious use of salvia has been a hotly debated in
the Salvia email list--to say the least! Perhaps one of the few
statements that most list members can agree upon regarding entheogenic
use of salvia is &quot;Some people take salvia with the intent of having a
spiritual or religious experience and claim to be able to achieve one
from it&quot;. Beyond that the issue gets extremely controversial dealing
with such questions as what are true religious beliefs, the nature of:
God,/Goddess, gods, spirits, void, consciousness, the soul, proper
methods of meditation, spirituality etc. These are questions about which
no consensus is possible.<br>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 10"></A>X. ABOUT SALVINORIN (and related substances)</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What&#39;s in salvia that is so strong? Is it an alkaloid?</FONT></B><br>
A. Salvia contains a substance called salvinorin A. Salvinorin A is the most potent naturally occurring vision inducer.  Salvinorin A is not an alkaloid--its molecule contains only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Technically it is a neoclerodane diterpenoid. Salvinorin A is a unique vision inducing substance, of great power. It is NOT an analog of any other drug.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Just how strong is it?</FONT></B><br>
A. When vaporized and inhaled, doses of about 250 micrograms (that is 250 millionths of a gram) can have threshold effects and doses of 1 milligram (one thousandth of a gram) can have extreme effects. Sensitivity varies greatly from person to person. Salvinorin is most effective when inhaled as smoke or vapor and least effective on a milligram basis when swallowed.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Are there other psychoactive substances present in Salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. Possibly. A substance known as divinorin C has been recently reported by Valdés <I>et. al</I> to be behaviorally active in mice at even lower dosage than salvinorin A. Divinorin C is closely related chemically to salvinorin A and is present in his salvia extracts in 1/9 the concentration of salvinorin A. It may contribute to the psychoactive effects of salvia leaves. Divinorin C has never been bioassayed in humans due (among other reasons) to the difficulty in preparing pure samples in significant quantity for such bioassay. A few other salvinorin like compounds are known to be present in salvia and may also contribute to its psychoactivity. However, salvinorin A is the only <I>Salvia divinorum</I> compound presently known to be psychoactive in humans.<p>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Can salvinorin A be used safely?</FONT></B><br>
A. The primary danger in using refined salvinorin A is overdose. It can only be used safely if the dose has been measured precisely. It is active in extremely minute quantities - so small in fact that a dose could easily fit on the head of a pin. Quantities this small can only be accurately measured using an analytical balance. Such weighing equipment usually costs two or three thousand dollars. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">NEVER ESTIMATE A DOSE OF Salvinorin A VISUALY. IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE WEIGHED.</FONT> Don't experiment with this material unless you are 100% certain that the dose has been measured accurately. To learn more about the potential dangers of salvinorin A, go to the following URL: <A HREF="caution.html">http://sagewisdom.org/caution.html</A><br><br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is it possible to estimate salvinorin content of leaves without having an organic chemistry lab at one&#39;s disposal?</FONT></B><br>
A. Yes it can be done in a crude fashion. If you have a gram scale weigh
the material and assume that there is APPROXIMATELY 3 mg salvinorin per
gram of ordinary (unenhanced) dried leaf.
If you lack a gram scale (it would be a good idea to buy one) you could<br>
use volume measure and assume 1.37 G of powdered leaf per level teaspoon.<br>
Roughly (but only roughly) this gives:<br>
1 level tsp. dried leaf powder = about 4 mg salvinorin<br>
1/2 level tsp. dried leaf powder = about 2 mg salvinorin<br>
1/4 level tsp. dried leaf powder = about 1 mg salvinorin<br>
1/8 level tsp. dried leaf powder = about 1/2 mg salvinorin<br>
These figures are based on a weighing of powdered leaves which gave a
reading of 1.37 grams per tsp. and on an estimated salvinorin content of
3 mg salvinorin per gram of dried leaf. This estimate is consistent with
the comment of Leander Valdes III that based on his research he &quot;would
guess the salvinorin A content in dried leaves to be at least 2.5 - 3.0
mg/g and possibly higher.&quot; These figures are not exact - they will depend on packing density. Also, leaf quality and salvinorin concentration will vary. Leaf samples analyzed by John Gruber ranged from 0.86 mg - 3.94 mg salvinorin per gram of dried leaf with an <I>average</I> concentration of 2.45 mg per gram.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How can I make salvinorin?</FONT></B><br>
A. You can&#39;t. Salvinorin has not been synthesized yet and synthesis
would be an extremely difficult if not impossible undertaking for even
the most skilled chemist.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How can I extract it?</FONT></B><br>
A.&nbsp; Extracting pure salvinorin is not a task to be undertaken in your
home. If you are a reasonably skilled organic chemist and have access to
an organic chemistry lab and fairly sophisticated equipment it is
possible to extract pure salvinorin from dried leaves. If you intend to
use it it will be necessary to weigh out dosage very precisely. Ordinary
balances are not accurate enough for this task.&nbsp; The accuracy&nbsp; of the
balances used should be to within 10&nbsp; micrograms (that&#39;s micrograms not
milligrams)&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">WARNING: Attempts to extract salvinorin by amateurs are fraught with danger including solvent toxicity, fire, explosion and overdosing.</FONT> This
FAQ will not give recipes telling how to extract salvinorin; but if you

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is known about the neurological mechanism of action for salvinorin A?</FONT></B><BR>
A. Salvinorin A is a potent, highly selective kappa opioid receptor agonist. Experimental evidence indicates that the psychoactive effects of salvinorin A result from its activity at these receptors. Self-experiments performed by Daniel Siebert have demonstrated that the effects of salvinorin A are inhibited by pre-administration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What are opioid receptors?</FONT></B><BR>
A. Opioid receptors are a particular class of chemical-recognition proteins located on cell membranes in many organs, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. These proteins produce an effect in the cell when they come into contact with chemicals that both "bind" to them and trigger activity.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Since salvinorin A activates kappa opiate receptors, does that mean that salvinorin A is chemically similar to opiate drugs?</FONT></B><BR>
A. No. Salvinorin A is in an entirely different class of compounds. Opiates are alkaloids. Salvinorin A is a diterpenoid. It is an organic compound of plant origin that contains only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Unlike alkaloids, it does not contain nitrogen. To a chemist this is a major difference. This chemical difference has an important practical consequence: salvinorin A should not give a positive reaction on urine tests for opiates or other alkaloid drugs.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What are the differences between different types of opioid receptors?</FONT></B><BR>
A. There are three main groups of opioid receptors: mu, kappa, and delta. These receptors are similar to each other in protein structure but link to a variety of distinct intracellular G-coupling proteins that function to cause the receptors' unique physiologic effects on target organs. Different endogenous ligands (enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins, etc.) bind to them to differing extent. So do various drugs. Substances that activate receptors are known as agonists, those that block them are known as antagonists, those that activate some types of receptors while at the same time blocking others are called mixed agonist/antagonists. There are selective agonists and selective antagonists for different receptor types. As a result of studies with these it has been found that each major receptor has a unique anatomic distribution in brain, spinal cord, and the periphery, e.g. gut. Each receptor type has its unique but often overlapping profile of actions.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does salvinorin A activate a different set of opiate receptors than addictive opiate drugs such as morphine?</FONT></B><BR>
A. There are very significant differences in which opioid receptors are activated by morphine compared with salvinorin A, these differences result in morphine, but NOT salvinorin A, being addictive. To be more specific, morphine activates both mu and kappa opioid receptors. It activates mu receptors strongly, these are the receptors responsible for opiate dependence. It activates kappa receptors, but only weakly. Thus morphine is powerfully addictive but produces only borderline visionary effects (morphine induced visions, when they occur at all, are similar to daydreams). In contrast salvinorin A is a powerful SELECTIVE kappa agonist. It strongly activates the vision-inducing kappa receptors but does NOT activate the addiction producing mu receptors. So, unlike opiate drugs such as morphine, salvinorin produces remarkably powerful visions, but not addiction.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. It is well known that some opiate drugs are addictive. Is there any danger of this with salvia?</FONT></B><BR>
A. NO. No one has ever reported any addictive behavior with respect to the use of salvinorin A or <I>Salvia divinorum.</I> Addictive behavior is compulsive drug use. The key word is compulsive. To produce it, a drug must be a powerful "reinforcer," as opiates such as morphine indeed are. The powerful reinforcing effect of opiates depends on dopamine release in a part of the brain called the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Both mu and delta agonists produce dopamine release in this region; however, selective kappa agonists do not. This dopamine-mediated reinforcement (euphoria, rush, buzz, reward) is very important in determining if a drug will be addicting or not. And dopamine induced euphoria is different from the mechanisms underlying both physical dependence and tolerance. It is dopamine related euphoria more than tolerance or physical dependence that will determine if a drug is liable to be habitually abused. Anyhow, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens may be why animals and people will choose to repetitively self-administer morphine, heroin, etc. Surprisingly, stimulation of the kappa receptor has the opposite effect. It decreases dopamine release in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens, and in experimental animals this discourages self-administration. The decreased dopamine release that results from kappa receptor stimulation may be the reason why <I> Salvia divinorum, </I>  and salvinorin A, do NOT cause addiction.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. In what parts of the brain does it act?</FONT></B><br>
A. This is not known for sure but from the subjective and behavioral
effects it can be surmised that salvinorin is almost certainly affecting
the limbic system, and may be affecting somatosensory (parietal lobe),
cerebellar and vestibular function as well.<br>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 11"></A>XI. DANGERS AND PRECAUTIONS</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does salvia cause a hangover? Are there any after-effects?</FONT></B><br>
A. Most people do not feel unpleasantly hungover after using Salvia. A few people do report a mild headache, bronchial irritation, insomnia or irritability. These symptoms seem to be reported more often by smokers than by quid chewers, and perhaps might be due to some combustion products, such as carbon monoxide rather than to salvinorin.<BR><BR>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. For how long after using salvia is a person's ability to drive impaired?</FONT></B><br>
A. Most people feel they can drive safely by 3 hours after smoking Salvia, or 4 hours after chewing it. Many believe they can safely drive even sooner than this. The duration of impairment after drinking the infusion might be up to 8 hours. But studies of the duration of impairment, after taking salvia by any route, have never been done. Therefore it is a good idea to be extra careful when driving for a couple of days after using Salvia.<BR><BR>

<!--<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does salvia cause brain damage?</FONT></B><br>
A. Not so far as is known. However salvinorin has some phenomenological
similarities to dissociatives such as PCP and ketamine, and these
dissociatives can cause brain damage (Olney&#39;s Lesions) if taken in very
high dose. Therefore the possibility that salvinorin might cause brain
damage if taken in excessive dosage cannot be completely discounted.
However, there have been no reports of any brain damage from salvinorin
in man or animals. For those chewing quids of salvia leaves there would
seem to be no danger of brain damage at all. Chewing leaves is the very
safe traditional mode of use. For those vaporizing pure salvinorin in
high dosage who knows? Vaporizing pure salvinorin makes possible dosages
far in excess of that any traditional user has encountered, so the
safety of traditional usage patterns cannot guarantee the safety of
using pure salvinorin.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Are there psychiatric dangers?</FONT></B><br>
A. Probably there are for some individuals. Acutely, salvia and
salvinorin induce what could be termed a &#39;toxic psychosis&#39; in other
words one may see visions, hear voices, have bizarre thought patterns
etc. This is normal when tripping. The acute effects of salvia (both
desirable and undesirable) wear off very quickly. However for some
people the overwhelming strangeness of the salvia experience (or perhaps
some direct effect of salvinorin in the brain) can trigger panic
attacks. Some individuals with&nbsp; schizophrenia or other psychotic
disorders (even if in remission) might experience a salvia induced
relapse, or exacerbation of their condition. People with Borderline
Personality Disorder even when not on any drug often depersonalize, self
mutilate, make suicide gestures or attempts, commit antisocial acts, and
get into fights. Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder might
become even more unstable when under the influence of Salvia. Although
some depressives have reported that salvia has lifted their depression,
for others it may make a preexisting depression acutely worse. For such
an individual there may be risk of suicide. However, no salvia related suicides have been reported.<br>-->

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does salvia cause any physical damage?</FONT></B><br>
A. There are no known health problems from oral salvia use. However, it
is known that smoking tobacco is damaging to your lungs and may cause
cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, stroke and cardiovascular disease. These
toxic side-effects of tobacco smoking are not due mainly to nicotine but
rather to combustion products (tars and carbon monoxide), which are
present whenever any type of plant material (e.g. Salvia) is smoked.
Common sense will tell you that smoking Salvia, or any material, can be
bad for your health. It is not known if salvia can cause birth defects,
but it is prudent to assume that it could.<br>
<br>
<!--<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Is salvia addicting?</FONT></B><br>
A. Although salvia is not believed to be addicting, it should be borne
in mind that some very habit forming drugs including tobacco, heroin,
cocaine and benzodiazepines also were initially thought not to be
addicting.&nbsp; No physical dependence on salvia or salvinorin has been
reported. The usual usage pattern is not one of daily use. Indeed such
would be quite unusual. Withdrawal symptoms have not been reported.
Compulsive use is not something that SALVIA list e-mail members or
others are reporting. Episodes of excessive dosage have occurred, but
such abuse is likely to have very unpleasant consequences (panic,
injuries, fires, falls, severe social humiliation, etc.) and is unlikely
to be repeated.&nbsp; It is quite unlikely that anyone using salvia in the
traditional fashion (by chewing quids of leaves occasionally) will
become &#39;addicted&#39;. Whether this freedom from addictive risk also holds
for smoking leaves, smoking extract enriched leaves, vaporizing powdered
leaves or vaporizing salvinorin is something only time will tell.
Prudence and general health concerns would advise not inhaling Salvia
smoke (or vapor) into your lungs often.<br>
<br>-->
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Can you take a fatal overdose?</FONT></B><br>
A. No case of fatal salvinorin poisoning has been reported. The human
oral lethal dose is not known but is believed to be extremely high.
Leander Valdes, III provided&nbsp; the following information for inclusion in
this FAQ regarding acute toxicity studies in mice: &quot;I tested Salvinorin
A intraperitoneally in mice at very high doses and it appeared to be not
very toxic. This was long before the compound was being taken orally and
it was testing about as potent as mescaline in the assay I was using. In
light of the extreme potency of the compound, I think it quite possible
and probably very likely that it was not being well absorbed. I had it
in a mix of corn oil, tween 80 (a fancy emulsifier) and water.
Dissolving the compound in solvents such as ethanol, acetone or DMSO
probably delivers quite a bit more drug to the body (I didn&#39;t use them
because I wanted an inactive vehicle). &quot;<br>
<br>
Swallowed salvinorin is not well absorbed. The chances of inadvertently
swallowing a lethal overdose of an oral preparation of leaves, slurry or
elixir are extremely low.<br>
<br>
If salvinorin is inhaled as multiple inhalations of leaf smoke or vapor
one&nbsp; could reasonably expect to pass out&nbsp; before he/she could take a
lethal overdose. But significantly, nothing is known about the toxic
effects of smoking truly massive &#39;single bolus&#39; doses of pure
salvinorin, such a practice might be quite dangerous, and should
certainly be avoided.<br>
<br>
Although fatal poisoning from Salvia divinorum appears to be very
unlikely to occur; there is another type of lethal overdose --- one that
kills not by poisoning but by impairing judgment and survival instincts
and causing fatal injury. If you smoked salvinorin and then walked out
of a ten story&nbsp; window you would be very dead indeed. That&#39;s why sitters
are needed when smoking or vaporizing high doses.<br>
<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Are there any negative interactions between salvia and other drugs, supplements, or medications?</FONT></B><br>
A. One should be particularly cautious about combining salvia with other drugs. As is the case with most drugs, some combinations may interact in unexpected and possibly negative ways.<br>
<br>
Many people who are taking regular medications do use salvia with no adverse effects. Although salvia appears to be relatively safe when combined with many medications, there probably are some drugs that it should not be combined with. It is important to remember that each individual is unique. The fact that some people do not experience problems with a particular combination does not guarantee that that combination is safe for everyone.
<br>
<br>
If you must combine salvia with another drug, you should always do so cautiously. Start with an extremely conservative dose so as to reduce the risk, should a negative reaction occur. If no negative reaction occurs, you can try increasing the dosage slightly on subsequent attempts. Provided that no adverse effects are experienced, you can increase the dose until you obtain the desired level of effects. One should always have an alert, responsible sitter present when experimenting with new combinations. It is important to have someone on hand who can help you, should the need arise.

We advise against combining salvia with other consciousness-altering substances. There have been reports of people having difficult experiences with such combinations. We are aware of one individual who reported that his breathing became somewhat constricted and labored for several minutes when he smoked salvia following a high dose of the "nutritional supplement," GABA. While it is not certain that this reaction was due to an interaction of the two drugs, it would be prudent to avoid this combination.<br>
<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. When do you need a sitter?</FONT></B><br>
A. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Having a sitter present is absolutely essential whenever you are taking a dose that might be high enough to cause you to lose awareness of your physical environment, freak out, or become delusional.</FONT> Losing awareness of your physical environment can be dangerous because you are not aware of how your body might be interacting with its surroundings. This could result in physical injury to yourself or others (falls, fires, etc.). Do not take salvia without a sitter unless you are certain that you can safely handle the dose. You should have a sitter if you are at all uncertain. A sitter is needed whenever a user is new to Salvia, is uncertain of the potency of the Salvia that they will be using, is experimenting with a more powerful preparation than he/she has used before, or is using a more powerful delivery system than previously. It is generally advisable to have a sitter present when using highly concentrated salvia extracts and when using the vaporization method of smoking. Exercise caution and use good judgment. Many people choose to have a sitter present even when they are using low doses that can be handled safely without one.<br><br>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What should a sitter know?</FONT></B><br>
A. The sitter should be supportive, congenial, sensible, and sober. Above all remember that no matter how crazy the person undergoing the experience gets, the effects of Salvia are short lived. Within an hour (usually much less) the person will be back in consensus reality, behaving normally. It&#39;s very reassuring to hold onto this knowledge when things seem impossibly messy. It helps to have done salvia yourself before sitting another person. Experience with classical psychedelics is only partially helpful. The sitter should know that salvia is different&nbsp; from these, especially in terms of dissociative effect. Touching to "ground" the person may frighten the person. If you plan on touching, clear it with the person before they begin the experience. The sitter should realize that he/she has a primary role, a secondary role, and a tertiary role.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the primary role?</FONT></B><br>
A. The primary role is to keep the person safe. and keep those
around that person safe. This must take precedence over all else. The
main dangers to be guarded against are physical, not emotional. Your
primary job is &#39;guardian&#39; not psychotherapist.&nbsp; Do not use physical
force unless nothing else will do. Use of physical force may result in
injury. It could be misinterpreted as
an&nbsp; assault. Never let salvia be used in settings in which firearms,
knives or other potentially dangerous objects are present. Keep the
person safe from falls, head banging, sharp objects, walking through
windows, wandering out into the street, open flames,&nbsp; hot surfaces and
breakable objects. But let the person move about in a safe area. Do not
grab or try to physically restrain the subject. Do&nbsp; redirect him or her.
Speak softly. Take dangerous objects away. Use the minimum touching
necessary (the confused subject may perceive your touching as&nbsp; an
assault and react to the perceived danger). It is also the sitter&#39;s
responsibility to handle unexpected intrusions of strangers and other
awkward social situations. This may call for considerable creativity ;-).<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the secondary role?</FONT></B><br>
A. To reassure and reorient. Often simple repeated explanations may help
a frightened person, e.g. &quot;You&#39;re safe, I won&#39;t let anything harm
you.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re just having a bad trip, you&#39;ll feel better in a few minutes.&quot; &quot;Your name is (subject&#39;s name), I&#39;m (state your name) I&#39;m your (friend, lover, spouse etc.)&quot; . If speech is not called for, be silent.
Silence is&nbsp; often less threatening than trying to
decipher what a sitter is saying.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the tertiary role?</FONT></B><br>
A. To help the person later recall the details of their experience. There are several
techniques. Use a notebook and record the person&#39;s behavior
and&nbsp; utterances. You can later ask the person about specific actions that you recorded. That may jog his or her
memory about what they experienced. Another technique, if the person is
not too far gone to communicate during the experience, is to ask repeatedly
&quot;what are you experiencing now?&quot; A notebook,&nbsp; or more conveniently a tape recorder,&nbsp; can be used to record responses.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Any safety Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts?</FONT></B><br>
A. Common sense guidelines are:<br>
• Choose the time and place of your salvia experience carefully. Privacy and safety
are essential.<br>
• Choose your dose and mode of delivery carefully.<br>
• Lie down for the duration of the experience. You&#39;re pretty darn safe in bed
if you&#39;re not smoking there.<br>
• Have a sitter (this is especially important if you are new to Salvia,
taking a high dose or using an efficient delivery system such as
vaporization.<br>
• As a general rule do not mix salvia with any other other psychoactive
substances. If you are quite experienced with salvia ,and with the other
substance, you might decide to ignore this advice at some point; but&nbsp; if you do so you are playing guinea pig. When you play guinea pig risks
increase. If you decide to play guinea pig having a sitter present would
be a wise precaution.<br>
• If you are currently having mental health problems or have a history
of same,&nbsp; don&#39;t take salvia without first discussing it with your mental health practitioner.<br>
• Don&#39;t give salvia to minors,&nbsp; or to violent or unstable individuals.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What is the legal status of Salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is a legal plant in most countries. Missouri, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Delaware are the only states in the USA that prohibit its use. <i>Salvia divinorum</i> is entirely legal in all other US states. Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, and South Korea are the only countries that have enacted legislation making possession of <i>Salvia divinorum</i> and/or salvinorin A illegal. Spain prohibits the sale of <i>Salvia divinorum,</i> but not possession or use. In Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Estonia, it is illegal to import <i>Salvia divinorum</i> without a relevant prescription from a doctor. Additional information about Salvia's legal status, and pending legislation that might affect it, is available at: <a href="legalstatus.html">http://sagewisdom.org/legalstatus.html</a>.
<P>

The authors of this FAQ are not attorneys and cannot render a legal
opinion. If you have a question regarding the legal issues surrounding <i>Salvia
divinorum</i> or salvinorin, you should consult an attorney knowledgeable
about drug law.<p>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How can I help prevent criminalization of salvia?</FONT></B><br>
A. Practice and encourage responsible use. Do not provide salvia to
minors or unstable individuals. Never use salvia in settings in which
firearms, knives or other potentially dangerous objects are present. Do
not mix with alcohol. Never drive while under the influence of Salvia.
Be extra careful of flames - candles, lighters, fire etc when using
Salvia. Discourage mixing salvia with other drugs. Encourage the
practice of using sitters. Discourage use of pure salvinorin (except in
research settings), vaporized extracts, vaporized leaves, and smoking of
powerful extract enhanced leaves. Taking oral preparations and smoking
unenhanced leaves are less likely to produce out of control behavior. Be
careful about granting interviews. The press and media in general is
often more interested in sensationalizing than in balanced factual
reporting.<p>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. Does <i>Salvia divinorum</i> show up on drug tests?</FONT></B><br>
A: No. Tests have not been developed to detect use of <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> Although it may be possible for a properly equiped lab to identify traces of salvinorin A or its metabloites in urine, it is not something that would be done in an ordinary drug test. Certainly, this should be of no concern in countries where <i>Salvia divinorum</i> remains legal. The active principal, salvinorin A, is not chemically similar to other drugs typically tested for, and therefore it should not produce a false-positive result when testing for other drugs.<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#DF0083"><A NAME="Section 13"></A>XIII. PROCESSING PLANT MATERIAL</FONT><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How could I dry leaves?</FONT></B><br>
A. There are several methods which all give good results.<br>
<br>
Method 1.) &quot;Nature&#39;s Bounty&quot;<br>
Wait till the leaves die or are shed. Gather them. Place them on a plate
in a room with low humidity. Wait until they are dry then store. It is
not known if naturally shed leaves are stronger or weaker than picked
leaves. Advantage you won&#39;t be depriving your plants of leaves it needs.
Disadvantage you will have to wait until the plant is ready to make a
donation to your cause. Leaves may not be in prime condition<br>
<br>
Method 2) &quot;Salvia Tobacco&quot;<br>
List-member Michael Steinmetz recommends the following: Take big leaves
and place one atop another (like stacking sheets of paper). Then cut
through the pile making 1/2 cm. (1/4 inch)&nbsp; strips. Pile these on a
plate into a heap. Turn them twice daily until they are dry but not
crispy. The resulting &#39;tobacco&#39; is said to give a smoother smoke than
thoroughly dried leaves; however is possible that this slow partial
drying results in weaker leaves that may not keep as long as&nbsp; thoroughly
dried (crispy) leaves.<br>
<br>
Method 3) &quot;Food Dehydrator&quot;<br>
Dry in a food dehydrator. A Mr. Coffee&reg;&nbsp; brand food dehydrator works
very well. Drying is very fast and thorough. Dry until the entire leaves
including the leaf stem are crispy. Your fingers can tell you when they
are ready. Advantages: speed, thorough drying.&nbsp; and convenience.
Disadvantages cost of buying a dehydrator.<br>
<br>
Method 4). &quot;Conventional Oven Method&quot;<br>
Place on an oven proof dish. Oven dry in an oven set at no more than 150
degrees F. Similar to method 3) although a&nbsp; little less convenient;
however, more people have ovens than food dehydrators.<br>
<br>
Method 5). &quot;Microwave Oven Method&quot;<br>
Lay the leaves in a single layer between two paper towels and microwave them on high for 10 seconds at a time, checking after each period, until they are dry enough to store.<br>
<br>
Method 6). &quot;Calcium chloride Drying&quot;<br>
List-member &quot;cystonic&quot; recommends: Get Damp-rid (Calcium Chloride)
refills and place sufficient amount in the bottom of a Tupperware
container.&nbsp; Place a piece of aluminum foil atop the CaCl2, and place
leaves to be dried on top of foil.&nbsp; Curling edges is recommended as to
avoid contact with the CaCl2.&nbsp; Seal container, and leaves will be dry in
approx. 2 days Advantage very thorough drying. Disadvantages less
convenient than other methods. Slow.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How should I store dried leaves and how long will they last?</FONT></B><br>
A. Place them in a sealed jar away from light. A clean glass canning
jar works very well (1 quart Mason jar). Storing the jar inside a
kitchen cabinet or medicine chest will keep it away from light. Stored
this way leaves will keep their potency for many months or even years.
Storing dry leaves in a sealed jar in a freezer may give even longer
shelf life.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. I’ve heard talk of salvia extracts and I’m confused. The term seems
to be used in various ways.</FONT></B><br>
A. It is confusing because the term is often used to refer to various
preparations derived from Salvia. Technically, in pharmacy and medicine
the dictionary definition of an extract is: a solid preparation obtained by evaporating a solution of a drug. There is also such a thing as a fluid extract (or tincture), which is a concentrated
liquid preparation containing a definite proportion of the active
principles of a medicinal substance. The solvent usually used is ethyl
alcohol or a mixture of ethyl alcohol and water. However various salvia
preparations are often referred to (loosely) as extracts.<br>
<br>
<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What are the advantages of using extracts?.</FONT></B><br>
A. Extracts allow one to explore deeper
levels than are available using plain leaf. This is particularly
important for people who find that they are not very sensitive to S.
divinorum. Another advantage to these products is that they are far
easier to consume, since less material needs to be ingested or smoked. 
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. How safe are extracts?.</FONT></B><br>
A. They are safe if prepared properly and used wisely. It is highly recomended that you have a sitter present when experimenting with any enhanced or concentrated form of <i>Salvia divinorum.</i> Poorly manufactured extracts, or fortified leaves may contain traces of toxic
solvents or other residues. Unless standardized, the strength of these preparations may vary.
Apart from possible solvent toxicity, the main danger is from fires,
falls, burns and confused behavior resulting in injury. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Extract can be quite powerful and must be used
carefully</FONT>. I generally recommend that people avoid using products
containing more than 15 mg. salvinorin A per gram of leaf (i.e. products
stronger than 6X) unless the dose has been weighed precisely. Be sure that you know what you are doing before experimenting with extracts, fortified leaves, and standardized salvinorin A enhanced leaf.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. What are these so called ‘extracts’? And what are they used for?</FONT></B><br>
A. They include:<BR>
<B>• <U>Crude extract fortified salvia leaves</U></B>. When you hear of ‘5X extract’,
fortified leaf material is what is being referred to. An extract of
salvia is made using a solvent such as ethanol or acetone. The solvent,
which now contains dissolved extracted material, is evaporated onto
salvia leaves, where the dissolved material is deposited. This final
material, whose salvinorin content has been increased by this procedure,
is often termed ‘extract’, although technically it should be called
‘extract fortified leaves’. Fortified leaves are usually smoked, although
they may be active sublingually as well. The most common product
currently on the market is called "5X." It is prepared by adding the
crude extract obtained from 4 units of leaf back onto 1 unit of leaf.
The resulting product is thus 5 times as potent as the leaves used to
produce it. This type of product is somewhat variable in actual potency,
because the potency of the leaves used to produce it varies. It has a
somewhat sticky feel and inferior burning characteristics due to the
impure, tar-like quality of the extract. A 5X ‘extract’ is a final product that
is 5 times as strong as the original untreated leaves. Extract fortified
leaves of various strengths are available: 5X, 6X, 10X, 15X, etc.<p>

<B>• <U>Standardized Salvinorin A Enhanced Leaf</U></B>. This material contains a specific concentration of pure
salvinorin A deposited on a small quantity of leaf material. Unlike extract fortified leaf made with crude extract, this material is enhanced with pure salvinorin A. This product is ideal for smoking, because it minimizes the amount of ‘tars’ and carbon monoxide that would be inhaled.
Daniel Siebert sells two strengths at his <A HREF="salviashop.html">"Sage Wisdom Salvia Shop"</A>:<BR>
1.) <U>"Standard strength"</U>: This has been standardized to contain exactly
15 mg salvinorin A per gram of leaf. This is roughly six times the
average natural leaf concentration. One gram is sufficient for 15 - 30 uses.<BR>
2.) <U>"Extra strength"</U>: This is standardized to contain exactly 1 mg
salvinorin A per 25 mg of leaf (this is equivalent to 40 mg
salvinorin A per gram of leaf). Because of its strength, it should only
be used if the individual doses have been accurately weighed. Since most
people do not have the ultra accurate analytical balances necessary to do this, Daniel Siebert only sells this in individually packaged, pre-weighed, 25 mg. units.
This only produces a tiny wisp of smoke, so it is ideal for people who
want to minimize smoke
ingestion as much as possible. 25 mg. is sufficient for 1 - 2 uses for a
person of average sensitivity.<P>

<B>• <U>Salvia fluid extracts</U></B>. These are usually in the form of various salvia elixirs -- sweetened alcoholic fluid extracts. Instructions for making them are included in the FAQ.<P>

<B>• <U>Sage Goddess Emerald Essence</U></B>. A particularly effective, ultra-concentrated, refined tincture that is prepared using a unique new separation process developed by Daniel Siebert. This product is the most effective and reliable form of <I>Salvia divinorum</I> for oral use. It is available from <A HREF="salviashop.html">The Sage Wisdom Salvia Shop</A>.<p>

<B>• <U>Soft extracts</U></B>. This is a type of true extract. It is a semisolid
material obtained by extracting <i>Salvia divinorum</i> leaf with a solvent and
then evaporating the solvent completely. The resulting preparation is a
waxy or tarry product that is not sufficiently hard to be able to be
ground up into a powder. The soft extract (which may actually be fairly
hard like hard wax), is not deposited on leaves. This material is quite
suitable for sublingual use as a substitute for quid. The effects are
similar to quid but probably will be stronger, may come on a little
slower, and may last somewhat longer. The advantage over quid chewing
is user comfort, as a far smaller amount of material must be put into
ones mouth. Since the material is very concentrated (1/4 tsp. will
produce strong effects in many people) a large enough dose can be taken
to guarantee strong effects without the gagging that may accompany use of
large quids. For example: if 1/4 tsp. is ineffective, one could take 1/2
tsp. without gagging. Basic soft extracts but can easily be prepared in a kitchen. A method of
preparation is described below.<P>

<B>• <U>Hard extracts</U></B>. These can be prepared by a more complicated use of two
solvents in a separatory funnel, one to remove the oils and waxes but
leave the salvinorin and the other to dissolve the salvinorin. A hard
extract could be ground and used as a powder. No <i>Salvia divinorum</i> hard
extracts are being sold. Such a hard extract might be suitable for
vaporization or use as a nasal snuff. Instructions for making a hard
extract are not included in the FAQ.<P>




<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. I'm not a first time user. Smoking regular leaves doesn't have much
effect on me. Despite your warnings, I'd like to be able to make extract
enhanced leaves. How can I do that?</FONT></B><br>
A. If you cannot achieve sufficient effect with unenhanced leaves you
may wish to try extract enhanced leaves; however you should have a
sitter present when you try smoking these. Here is one way to make a 6X
enhancement. Note: attempting to make enhancements much stronger than
this will leave you with a sticky gummy mess.<P>

<U>Method</U>: Take your dried leaf material and divide it into two portions
one of which weighs 5 times as much as the other. Call the smaller
portion B and the larger portion A. For this example we will assume you
want to
make about 5 G of 6X extract enhanced leaves. You will need to start
with 30 G of leaf powder. You would divide the 30 G into a 5 G sample
and a 25 G sample.<P>

You will need a suitable solvent for dissolving salvinorin A. The
solvent should not contain any non-volatile impurities. Several
possibilities exist: ethanol, methylene chloride, 91% isopropyl alcohol,
acetone, etc.
If using ethanol. It is best to use either denatured ethanol or absolute
alcohol. Drinking alcohol of less than 190 proof is a poor solvent for
salvinorin because of its water content. Absolute alcohol is pure
ethanol, containing no more than 1% water. Denatured ethanol, is ethanol
that has been rendered unsuitable for human consumption by the addition
of a small percentage of a poisonous substance such as methanol or
isopropyl alcohol. It is usually much less expensive than absolute
alcohol or high proof drinking alcohol. When obtaining denatured
alcohol, look for the kind that is denatured with isopropyl alcohol
rather than methanol. It is much less toxic and therefore safer to
handle. Never consume an extract that has been prepared with denatured
alcohol until ALL traces of alcohol have been thoroughly evaporated. The
extraction below can be done using any of the above solvents. Ethanol is
the least toxic choice, and acetone is considered only slightly toxic.
Chloroform is a known carcinogen and should be avoided. The extraction
can be done at room temperature. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">CAUTION: BOTH ACETONE, AND ALL THE
TYPES OF ALCOHOL MENTIONED, ARE HIGHLY FLAMMABLE</FONT>. If working indoors a
spark proof fume hood should be used. Avoid static sparks from carpets
and use of flame. To avoid toxicity and fire, this extraction is best
done outdoors away from all sparks and sources of flame.<P>

Make sure the solvent used is of high purity and will evaporate
completely (hardware store solvents might contain impurities). To test
for non-volatile impurities, evaporate a drop of the solvent on a very
clean piece of clear glass. After the solvent is evaporated, hold the
glass over a black surface and look for any white deposits on the glass,
then hold it over a white surface and look for any dark deposits. Also
pick up the glass and look through it to see if there is any oily
residue. This is like checking ones eyeglasses to see if they are clean.
Any residual deposits on the glass indicate that the solvent leaves
residue i.e. that it is impure. If it leaves no residue or stain and no
residual odor or taste it is unlikely that it will leave any impurities
in your extract enhanced leaves, provided that it is thoroughly
evaporated from them prior to use.<P>

Powder the 25 G sample and place it into a glass mason jar that has a
screw top (make sure the seal on the jar top is not soluble in the
solvent). Add at least 125 ml (1/2 cup) of solvent. Screw on the top.
Shake well for 2 minutes. Let sit for a minimum of 24 hours (several
days might yield a more complete extraction). Shake periodically (at
least 5 or 6 times over the course of the extraction period). Then pour
the entire contents of the jar though a fine mesh wire strainer (a tea
strainer will do). Save all the solvent. With the back of a spoon
squeeze the stuff in the strainer dry. Save the solvent that you squeeze
out. Re-extract the filtered leaf material in an addition 125 ml fresh
solvent. As before, filter and squeeze the leaves dry, saving the
solvent squeezed out. Pool all the solvent that has been in contact with
the leaf material. Discard the spent leaves. Place the solvent in a
broad, shallow container such as a pan or baking sheet. The container
should be made of glass, stainless steel or Teflon lined steel. Cover
with a wire strainer or screen and allow to evaporate out of doors. If
this is impractical evaporation can be done indoors next to an exhaust
fan or under a fume hood (open windows to insure good ventilation). Be
careful though if the exhaust fan motor emits electrical sparks it may
ignite the vapors. If doing indoor evaporation choose a solvent low in
toxicity. When little solvent is left, add portion B of the leaves. Stir
with a wooden utensil. Spread out thinly and allow to continue to air
dry. The leaves will absorb the residual liquid. Allow to air dry
thoroughly until free of all solvent odor and if possible until dry to
the touch. Break up any clumps. Finally, the extract should be spread
out thinly on an oven proof plate and placed in a 150 to 170 degree F
oven for an hour. Exposure to this temperature will not destroy
salvinorin but should remove any residual traces of solvent. The oven
door should be cracked open an inch during this final "desolventing."
Store in a sealed jar.
Test by opening the jar after a day and smelling. If a solvent odor is
present there is still residual solvent in the material and further
drying is required prior to use.<P>

You now have your smoking mixture. This is a 6X enhancement i.e.
theoretically the leaf material is now 6 times as strong as unenhanced
leaf material, so smoke it with great care, and have a sitter present.
This stuff can be very strong.<P>


<B><FONT COLOR="#33FF00">Q. I don’t want to chew quid or to smoke, how can a soft extract for
sublingual use be made?</FONT></B><br>
A. Strong preparations have been made using ethanol and using 91%
isopropyl alcohol. Please note there have been no studies of the safety
of sublingual soft extract. It is theoretically possible that the
material might contain some harmful substance, either extracted from the
plant or produced by reaction with solvent or in the oven heating phase
of the preparation. Users have not reported side-effects from sublingual
soft-extract but long term dangers (if any) are unknown. Since this material
is waxy, it might not be a good idea to smoke it because one might be
inhaling wax vapors into ones lungs. Various solvents can be used to
make a soft extract. Extracts made using both ethanol and 91% isopropyl
alcohol have proven effective.<P>
The following recipe worked to prepare an isopropyl alcohol soft
extract. The final product was a greenish black waxy substance about the
consistency of beeswax. It looked like tar but had a tealike aroma and
slightly bitter taste. It proved highly effective sublingually in a dose
of 1/4 tsp.<P>

1. Grind up a large amount of dried salvia leaves. Grind them finely.
You need not weigh the starting material. The more leaf material you
start with the more soft extract you will get. So use as much as you can spare.<BR>
2. Place the ground up leaves in a polyethylene container with a well
sealing polyethylene top. Polyethylene will not dissolve in isopropyl
alcohol. Neither will glass but the rubber seals on glass jar lids may,
so stick to polyethylene containers.<BR>
3. Add enough 91% isopropyl alcohol to cover the leaf material twice
over. 91% isopropyl alcohol is available in pharmacies over the counter.
It is used by some diabetics to sterilize reusable insulin syringes, and
is pharmaceutical grade (very pure).<BR>
4. Shake the alcohol leaf powder mixture twice daily for at least a
couple of days. The longer you do this the more complete the extraction
will be. Leaving the material sit in a closet for weeks or even months
will not hurt the final product. But two days with good shaking may be
all that is needed.<BR>
5. If all the leaf material has not settled to the bottom of the
container you will have to filter. Filtration is possible using cheese
cloth for preliminary filtration followed by filtering through a coffee
filter. If you left the container sit long enough you can skip the
filtration step as all the leaf material will have sedimented out. If it
has just decant the alcohol which was now greenish black in color.<BR>
6. Pout the more or less particle free green black isopropyl alcohol
crude fluid extract into a Pyrex baking dish.<BR>
7. If weather permits evaporate it outdoors. Just cover with a clean
aluminum screen and let it evaporate at ambient temperature. If indoor
evaporation is necessary set it next to an exhaust fan for 48 hours.<BR>
8. Once all the alcohol has evaporated the mixture will no longer smell
like rubbing alcohol but may contain water and be slimy. Expect a wet
slimy greenish-black material to be coating the Pyrex baking dish. Once
it no longer smells of alcohol place the pan in a 150 degree oven for a
couple of hours. You may want to crack the oven open about an inch to
let any residual alcohol vapors escape.<BR>
9. At this point the material in the pan should be a crust of film
coating the pan. Open the oven and remove the pan from the oven and let
it cool some but not down to room temperature.<BR>
10. With a plastic spatula scrape the black tar-like material off. There
will be a lot of scraping. The scrapings are the stuff you want so
don’t throw them out! Place these scrapings into a plastic bag. When
there is no more that can be scraped out of the pan take the scrapings
in your hands (make sure they are clean first) and using your fingers
roll the scrapings into a ball. Your fingers will become coated with the
tarry soft extract.<BR>
11. Place the ball back into the plastic bag and let it cool to room
temperature. As it does it will become stiffer.<BR>
12. The material can be stored at room temperature in a sealed plastic
bag. It will probably keep a very long time.<BR>
13. To measure a dose, scoop out a tiny piece with a small measuring
spoon e.g. 1./4 tsp size. Fill the measuring spoon with the extract. 
Since this is strong stuff and 1/4 tsp. is a large dose so you may want
to use an 1/8 tsp. measure, or alternatively measure 1/4 tsp. and then
cut than in half to get approximately 1/8 tsp.<BR>
14. To use, place the dose under your tongue. Lie down in a quiet place 
with dim lighting. Chew the waxy material occasionally, parking it under
your tongue between chews. Keep the Saliva formed in your mouth so
salvinorin can be absorbed from it. Swallowing the material won’t harm
you but swallowed salvinorin is not effective. Once you want to come
down, spit out the material remaining in your mouth and brush your teeth
to rid you mouth of the remaining extract. The effects develop gradually, but can become quite strong in sensitive individuals.

A. Traditional Mazatec healers have used <i>Salvia divinorum</i> to treat
medical and psychiatric conditions conceptualized according to their
traditional framework. Some of the conditions for which they use the
herb are easily recognizable to Western medical practitioners (e.g
colds, sore throats, constipation and diarrhea) and some are not, e.g.
&#39;fat lambs belly&#39; which is said to be due to a &#39;stone&#39; put in the
victims belly by means of evil witchcraft.<br>
<br>
Some alternative healers and herbalists are exploring possible uses for
Salvia. The problems in objectively evaluating such efforts and &#39;sorting
the wheat from the chaff&#39; are considerable.<br>
<br>
There are no accepted uses for <i>Salvia divinorum</i> in standard medical
practice at this time. A medical exploration of some possible uses
suggested by Mazatec healing practice is in order in such areas as cough
suppression (use to treat colds), and treatment of congestive heart
failure and ascites (is &#39;fat lamb&#39;s belly&#39; ascites?). Some other areas
for exploration include salvia aided psychotherapy (there is anecdotal
material supporting its usefulness in resolving pathological grief), use
of salvinorin as a brief acting general or dissociative anesthetic
agent, use to provide pain relief, use in easing both the physical and
mental suffering of&nbsp; terminal patients as part of hospice care, and a possible antidepressant effect.<br>
<br>
If a specific salvinorin receptor were discovered this would be of great
interest to psychopharmacology and neuroscience.<br>
