<P></B></CENTER><FONT size=+1>Picietl, peyotl, teonanactl, and ololuihqui- 
</FONT>these were the four great divinatory plants of Mexico at the time of the 
Conquest. We give the names in Nahuatl, the lingua franca of that time, spoken 
as a mother tongue by the Aztecs and many other peoples. By 'divinatory' we mean 
plants that served in Middle American cultures as keys to knowledge withheld 
from men in their normal minds, the keys to Extra-sensory Perception, the 
Mediators (as the Indians believed) between men and their gods. These plants 
were hallucinogens, psychotropic agents, psychotomimetics, if we must use the 
only words of contemporary science.

  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>Among the remote monolingual peoples of Mexico these plants continue 
      to this day playing their divine role. Whenever the Indian family is 
      troubled by a grave problem, it is likely to turn to one or the other of 
      these plants and consult it according to the usage prevailing in the 
      region. There were other drugs, certainly, that belong to the same class, 
      and of these more will be said later. But if we may rely on the number and 
      quality of the witnesses, the importance that they attribute to these 
      plants, and the strangely moving episodes that they tell us of the 
      Indians' utter faith in and defense of them--then these four were 
      pre-eminent.
      <P>The civilization of Europe had known nothing like these novel drugs of 
      Mexico, at least not in recorded history. Similar miraculous powers were 
      attributed, in a way, to the Elements in the Mass; and the Catholic Church 
      in Mexico was quick to perceive this, to it, alarming parallel. But belief 
      in the divinity of the Sacrament called for an act of faith, whereas the 
      Mexican plants spoke for themselves. 
      <P>In a number of situations the record is clear: the friars conceded the 
      miracles wrought by these agents, but attributed them to the machinations 
      of the Evil One. Root and branch, the Church strove to extirpate what is 
      called this superstition, this idolatry of the miracle-working plants. The 
      Church was unsuccessful; just how unsuccessful can be seen from the fact 
      that these plants are taken today, throughout the Indian country, in 
      ceremonials invoking the very name of the Virgin Mary, of the Saints 
      (especially St. Peter and St. Paul), of Our Lord.
      <P>The accessories to the rite are sold in every market place, at a 
      special stall, often in the shadow of the parish church. The 
      miracle-working plants pass from hand to hand by private arrangement; they 
      are never exposed like ordinary garden produce. The rite takes place in 
      midnight vigils, sometimes accompanied by stirring age-old chants in the 
      vernacular. The Indians attending these rites may include prominent lay 
      officials of the church; rumor has it that in certain places the priest is 
      the leading curandero.
      <P>Let it not be forgotten that the primary use of the sacred plants was 
      and continues to be religious--and by the same token medicinal. Religion 
      and medicine have not yet been separated out in many of the Indian 
      communities.

      <P><FONT size=+2><I>Picietl -- Nicotiana rustica L.<BR></I></FONT>
      <P>The bright green powder of picietl leaves is familiar all over the 
      Indian country in Mexico. The curandero rubs it on the skin, over the 
      forearms, temples, stomach, legs. It is this that constitutes a 
      <I>limpia</I> or ritual cleansing. Formerly, when mixed with one part of 
      lime to ten of picietl, it was made into a wad that the Indian inserted 
      between teeth and gums and sucked, much as the Quechua sucks coca, to give 
      him strength. The friars inveighed against picietl with a vehemence that 
      is proof of its importance in the native culture.
      <P>It is still indispensable in the religious life of the Indians. Is it 
      possible that picietl has pharmacological properties not yet discovered by 
      science? May there be surprises for us in this plant?
      <P>Picietl is Nicotiana rustica L., a sister species to our ordinary 
      tobacco, Nicotiana Tabacum L. They both grow in Mexico. In Nahuatl 
      together they are <I>yetl</I>, the former alone was <I>picietl</I> (now in 
      the vernicular <I>pisiete</I>), the latter alone was quauhyeyl. Tobacco 
      was already widely diffused throughout the Americas at the time of the 
      Conquest. The Spaniards found it in the Antilles, the Portuguese in 
      Brazil, the English in Virginia. Along with the plant the Spaniards took 
      the name 'tobacco' from the Taino people of Hispaniola and Cuba. Long 
      since dead and gone, this Arawakan tribe bequeathed to the world a legacy 
      of important words that gives us an engaging image of a blameless people: 
      'canoe', 'hammock', 'tobacco','maize', and 'potato', not to speak of a 
      sixth,'barbecue', that is in vogue today. 
      <P><A name=notas.2r>And so the Tainos, cultivating their maize and sweet 
      potatoes, smoking tobacco in their hammocks, paddling their canoes to the 
      neighboring barbecue, were destined to be exterminated by the ferocious 
      Caribs and the Europeans!<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.2"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
      <P>The use of tobacco spread throughout the world with epidemic speed. 
      European explorers penetrating to lands far distant in Africa and Asia 
      sometimes found that tobacco had reached there before them. Even the 
      Church did nothing to combat it--outside of Mexico, that is. The Frence 
      abbe with his snuff box is a familiar figure in Europe's cultural history.

      <P><FONT size=+2><I>Peyotl -- Lophophora Williamsii (Lem.) 
      Coult.<BR></I></FONT>
      <P>The history of peyotl, known to science as Lophophora Williamsii (Lem.) 
      Coulter, has been utterly different but equally spectacular. A cactus,<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.3"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> 
      it is by that fact exclusively a New World plant, native to the arid 
      regions of northern Mexico-to Coahuila, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, and 
      QuerCtaro. <A name=notas.4r>Presumably the plant in colonial times grew 
      only in the north, but its use extended south as far as the state of 
      Oaxaca.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.4"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> 
      Today the Indians of central and southern Mexico seem to know it no 
      longer. But the Indians of the north still consume it in ·their religious 
      ceremonies, and it is extending its range, inching its way northward from 
      tribe to tribe in the Plains area until it has now finally reached Canada. 
      In the same spirit of blind misunderstanding that actuated the Church in 
      colonial Mexico, there are elements in the North American community that 
      would invoke the police and courts to stop a practice that gives spiritual 
      solace to our surviving Indian population.
      <P><A name=notas.5r><A name=notas.6r>On a different cultural plane, peyote 
      made its bow in the great world in 1888, when the toxicologist Louis Lewin 
      of Berlin published the first paper attempting to classify it botanically 
      and describing its sensational qualities. He was followed by Dr. S. Weir 
      Mitchell (1896) and Havelock Ellis (1891), men who commanded wide 
      attention in the English-speaking world.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.5"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> 
      These papers served to alert the scientific and learned world to a new 
      order of vegetable product, and opened the sluice-gates to an astonishing 
      flow of discussion and experimentation. Though a booster dose was hardly 
      needed, Aldous Huxley gave the theme a new dimension when he published his 
      <A href="http://www.cnw.com/~neuro/gaz/fresh/doors.htm" target=_top><B>The 
      Doors of Perception</B></A> in 1954 and <B>Heaven and Hell</B> in 1955.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.6"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>
      <P><A name=notas.7r>The bibliography on peyotl is enormous: one North 
      American anthropologist, Weston La Barre, has devoted an important part of 
      his professional life to keeping up with it and chronicling current 
      developments.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.7"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> 
      The question presents itself seriously whether the output of articles can 
      be laid solely to the scientific interest of a strange drug, or whether 
      supplementing this there is a subjective effect that compels those who 
      have eaten the plant to embark upon a mission to make known what they have 
      experienced.
      <P><A name=notas.8r>Peyotl (which has commonly been eroded to 'peyote') is 
      a Nahuatl word. Alonso de Molina in his <B>Vocabulario</B> (1571) gives 
      its meaning as <I>capullo de seda, o de gusano</I>,'silk cocoon or 
      caterpillar's cocoon,' which fits well the small woolly cactus that is its 
      source. This is probably the explanation. Others <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.8"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> 
      cite a number of similar words in Nahuatl that invoke splendor or 
      illumination. May these words not be secondary, having been born of the 
      splendor of the visions that peyotl gives? For reasons that seem to have 
      sprung from popular confusion, the English-speaking population of the 
      Southwest came to call the dried peyotl 'mescal buttons.' Lewin, Mitchell, 
      and Ellis, by their use of the term, fixed this grievous misnomer in the 
      English language. Later, when the active agent came to be isolated, the 
      chemists called the alkaloid 'mescaline', thus compounding the 
      mistake.'Mescal' comes from the Spanish of Mexico <I>mezcal</I>, derived 
      in its turn from Nahuatl mexcalli, the name for the agave, maguey, or 
      century plant from which pulque is made, which, when distilled, yields 
      <I>mezcal</I>. <I>Mezcal</I> has nothing to do with 'mescal buttons' or 
      'mescaline'. This confusion is the lexicographers' nightmare, as can be 
      seen in many English-language dictionaries where erroneous citations are 
      given under the respective meanings of the word.
      <P><A name=notas.9r>On the other hand there is an important mejicanismo 
      that has largely escaped the lexicographers: piule, a generic name in 
      Mexico for the hallucinogens. J. J. Santamaria traces it to Zapotec, in my 
      opinion on insufficient grounds. I have heard it applied to hallucinogenic 
      mushrooms among the Zapotec-speakers of the Sierra Costera, at San 
      Augustin Loxicha: piucle de barda, piule de cheris, these being distinct 
      species of such mushrooms, or simply piule.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.9"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> 
      Does it not stem from peyotl, thus: 
      <CENTER><PRE><B> peyotl/peyutl --&gt; peyule ---&gt; piule.  </B></PRE></CENTER>
      <P>As Dr. Aguirre Beltran has shown us, in early colonial times peyotl was 
      in use in Oaxaca. The present-day currency of the word among some 
      monolingual Zapotecs might come down from that period.

      <P><FONT size=+2><I>Teonanacatl -- 'God's flesh'</I></FONT>
      <P>At least twenty-five of our early sources, many of them among our most 
      important, speak of teonanacatl,'God's flesh',<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.10"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> 
      the sacred mushrooms of Middle America. Bernardino de Sahagun refers to 
      them repeatedly and at some length. He gives in Nahuatl the text of his 
      native informants. Of the Nahuatl poems preserved for us, one mentions 
      them, and probably others refer to them metaphorically.
      <P>There are miniatures of them in two of the early codices. We in the 
      20th Century would have expected the European in colonial Mexico to try 
      them out, to satisfy his curiosity as to their properties. There is no 
      record of any such experiment. The Spaniards (if we may judge by their 
      words) at first rejected them with horror and loathing as an abomination, 
      and in the ensuing centuries simply ignored them.
      <P><A name=notas.11r><A name=notas.12r>Such was this neglect that in 1915 
      William E. Safford, a North American economic botanist of established 
      reputation, found it possible to read a major paper before a learned 
      society, afterwards published in a respectable learned journal, denying 
      that there had ever been sacred mushrooms in Mexico. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.11"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> 
      Virtually no one challenged him. In a world indifferent to such matters, 
      torn by warfare, his arguments won by default. Only a single thin voice 
      was raised in persistent protest, the voice of Dr. Blas Pablo Reko, a 
      Mexican citizen born in Austria of Slavic family background, a tireless 
      and enthusiastic field worker but one given to fanciful theories and so 
      not taken seriously. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.12"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> 
      He kept insisting not only that the mushrooms had existed but that the 
      cult survived in places off the beaten track in Oaxaca.
      <P><A name=notas.13r>Twenty years went by until, one day in 1936, Ing. 
      Roberto J. Weitlaner got his hands on some of the sacred mushrooms in 
      Huautla de Jiminez. He sent them to Reko, who forwarded them to Harvard, 
      where they arrived in such a state that they could not be identified. On 
      the record Ing. Weitlaner was the first white man in modern times to have 
      seen the teonanacatl. Two years later, on July 16, 1938, his daughter 
      Irmgard, with the young anthropologist who was destined to become her 
      husband, Jean Bassett Johnson, together with two others, Bernard Bevan and 
      Louise Lacaud, attended a mushroom rite in Huautla, in the home of Jose 
      Dorantes. Johnson later gave a full account of the event. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.13"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> 
      So far as the sources go, they were the first white persons to attend such 
      a ceremony.
      <P><A name=notas.14r>One month later, in mid-August, the Harvard botanist 
      Richard Evans Schultes, also in Huautla, received from native informants 
      specimens of three species that they said were of the sacred class. He 
      took them back to Cambridge. His field notes describe with unmistakable 
      precision the species that was to be defined in 1956 by Roger Heim as 
      Psilocybe caerulescens Murr. var. mazatecorum Heim. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.14"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A>
      <P><A name=notas.15r>Dr. David Linder, Harvard mycologist, confirmed 
      another as Panaeolus campanulatus L. var. sphinctinus (Fr.) Bresad. Some 
      time later the third species was identified at Harvard by Dr. Rolf Singer 
      as Stropharia cubensis Earle,<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.15"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> 
      but he did not disclose his discovery, not even to Schultes, until many 
      years later when it was too late to serve a purpose.
      <P>Then the Second World War supervened. Johnson was killed in North 
      Africa in 1942. Reko died in 1953. Schultes' activities were diverted to 
      other geographical regions. The outside world had been on the brink of 
      discovering the Mexican mushrooms, but the war blanketed everything and 
      the mushrooms slipped back into the well of the forgotten.
      <P>Meanwhile the matter was being approached from an altogether different 
      angle in New York, by the Wassons, husband and wife, who had spent more 
      than two decades gathering data on the role of mushrooms in primitive 
      societies in Eurasia. This theme in anthropology, which we called 
      <B>ethnomycology</B>, had never before been explored in the West. Eurasia 
      embraced so many cultures and so much history and literature that we had 
      resolved early in our inquiries to stop with Eurasia and leave Africa and 
      the Americas to others.
      <P>Our Eurasian studies had led us to formulate a bold surmise: viz., that 
      mushrooms had played a religious role in the lives of our remote 
      ancestors, a role far more important than the world had supposed.
      <P>We were still preoccupied with this idea when in September 1952, 
      suddenly, we learned that a mushroom cult had been reported in 16th 
      Century Mexico. On receipt of this, to us, sensational news, we resolved 
      to embark upon a quest for surviving traces of that cult.
      <P>At the time we knew nothing, absolutely nothing, about the cultures of 
      Middle America. What awaited us in Mexico turned out to exceed our most 
      sanguine anticipations, in the intellectual adventure of discovering for 
      ourselves the rich Indian cultures of Middle America and in our 
      rediscovery of the rite of the sacred mushroom.
      <P>In the beginning we discovered Ing. Roberto J. Weitlaner. Without 
      minimizing what we owe to others, I rejoice that this occasion presents 
      itself when I may properly define my debt to him.* He led us by the hand 
      on our first excursion on muleback into the Indian country, to Huautla de 
      Jimenez; on my second trip to Mazatlan de los Mixes; then on my visits to 
      San Augustin Loxicha in the Sierra Costera, and to the Mazahua country. 
      For ten years I have had repeated recourse to him, to tap his immense 
      knowledge of the Indians, their ways, their languages, their history. He 
      has guided my steps in the libraries, unearthed apt quotations in the 
      sources bearing on our theme, introduced me to others working in the field 
      who could also pin down facts. His patience, good humor, and joie de 
      vivre, in the Sierra and in Mexico City, are unfailing. But above all else 
      I have tried to learn from him his secret of dealing with the Indians.

      inferiors or children. You do not treat them "as though" they were equals. 
      The Indians are quick to see through such fronts. Ing. Weitlaner taught us 
      to treat the Indians as equals--a secret simple yet elusive. As the poet 
      said, truly 'this is the famous stone that turneth all to gold.' 
      <P><A name=notas.16r>The news of the Mexican sacred mushrooms burst upon

      <P><A name=notas.17r>Roger Heim, Membre de l'Institut, Director of the 
      Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, visited the Indian country of Mexico 
      three times in response to our invitation, seeking out the sacred 
      mushrooms. He identified fourteen species belonging to three 
      genera--Psilocybe, Stropharia, and Conocybe--besides a number of 
      subspecies. Most of them were new to science, although they had been known 
      to the Indians for centuries, probably millennia. Dr. Albert Hofmann in 
      the Sandoz laboratories of Basel undertook the delicate task of isolating 
      the active agents, defining their molecular structure, and finally 
      synthesizing them. By 1958, a surprisingly short time, he had accomplished 
      his work. Many investigators began to study the properties of psilocybine 
      and psilocine, as Dr. Hofmann called the active agents, and their possible 
      use. In a recent bibliography I have listed some 200 papers on work with 
      these mushrooms that have already appeared in the past five years, in 
      learned and scientific journals;<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.17"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> 
      not to speak of the hundreds of articles that have come out in a score of 
      countries in the lay press. Here again there seem to e signs that those 
      who have experienced the mushrooms feel a compulsion to impart to others 
      the staggering effects of teonanacatl.

      rediscovered and identified, there still remain other plants classed with 
      it in the colonial sources as possessed of divine (or Satanic) attributes 
      that defeat our efforts at interpretation. Both Sahagun and Juan de 
      Cardenas refer to a plant that they call respectively poyomatli or 
      poyomate,<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.18"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> 
      grouping it with other hallucinogens. Its identity is unknown. In his 
      <B>Medicina y Magia</B>, Dr. Aguirre Beltran cites other references to 
      this plant in the unpublished records of the Inquisition. He likewise 
      supplies numerous references to a second plant that belongs in the 
      divinatory group, a plant the name of which is variously spelled in his 
      sources but that he thinks in the original Nahuatl should be 
      pipiltzintzintli.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.19"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A>
      <P>Its identity, too, is unknown. The plant grew in the area where 
      ololiuhqui flourished; but whereas ololiuhqui is the seed of a morning 
      glory, the seed of pipiltzintzintli is never mentioned. It is called an 
      hierba, never an hiedra or bejuco like the morning glory. There was a 
      macho and an hembra, or male and female varieties. It was cultivated. 
      <P><A name=notas.20r>All of these attributes fit the <I>hojas de la 
      Pastora</I> that the Mazatecs generally use as a divinatory plant. In 
      September 1962 we gathered specimens of the <I>hojas de la Pastora</I>, 
      and they were found to be a species new to science: Epling and Jativa 
      named it Salvia divinorum. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.20"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> 
      Among the Mazatecs I have seen only the leaves ground on the metate, 
      strained, and made into an infusion. The colonial records speak of an 
      infusion made from the roots, stems and flowers. 
      <P>But this is not incompatible with our information about Salvia 
      divinorum: the Mazatecs may confine themselves to the leaves of a plant 
      that has the divine virtue in all its parts. I suggest that tentatively we 
      consider pipiltzintzintli, the divine plant of pre-Conquest Mexico, 
      identical with the Salvia divinorum now invoked in their religious 
      supplications by the Mazatecs.
      <P><A name=notas.21r>Of divinatory plants in use today that could have 
      been used in Middle America before the Conquest, we have had experience 
      with two: toloache, presumably the seeds of Datura meteloides Dun., and 
      colorines, the seeds of Rhynchosia pyramidalis (Lam.) Urb. Though I know 
      of no references to colorines in colonial sources, I think that they are 
      present in the famous Tepantitla fresco where strings of seeds and 
      mushrooms are falling from the hand of Tlaloc <I>(Editor's note: pictured 
      above in the opening graphic)</I>, and where some of the seeds are red and 
      black, with the hilum distinctly placed in the red held. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.21"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A>
      <P>On the slopes of Popacatepetl the sacred mushrooms are still taken with 
      colorines. It is vital that the hilum be in the red field; if it is in the 
      black patch, it is the toxic seed of Abrus precatorius L., also called 
      <I>colorinw (sic)</I> and much used for beads by the Veracruzanos.

      name=notas.22r>The least known in the outside world of our quartet of 
      major Mexican divinatory agents is ololiuhqui, yet it is perhaps the best 
      known and most widely used among the Indians of that country. In the race 
      for world attention ololiuhqui has been a slow starter. Beyond the 
      confines of the Sierra Madre few except specialists have heard of it, and 
      the bibliography on it is short. But its properties are as sensational as 
      those of teonanacatl and peyotl. Its identity was settled in 1941. The 
      enigma of its chemistry was resolved in 1960 when, on August 18 of that 
      year, Dr. Albert Hofmann read his paper in Australia before an audience of 
      scientists, many of whom were plainly incredulous, so astonishing were his 
      findings. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.22"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A>
      <P>Ololiuhqui in Nahuatl is the name of the seeds, not of the plant that 
      yields the seeds. The word means 'round thing', and the seeds are small, 
      brown, and oval. The plant itself is a climber, called appropriately 
      <I>coaxihuitl</I>, 'snake-plant', in Nahuatl, and <I>hiedra </I>or 
      <I>bejicco</I> by the Spanish writers. It is a morning glory, and it grows 
      easily and abundantly in the mountains of southern Mexico. Unlike 
      teonanacatl, it bears seed over months, and the seed can be kept 
      indefinitely and carried far and wide to regions where the plant itself 
      does not grow.
      <P>In Spanish it is commonly known as <I>semilla de la Virgen</I>, and in 
      the various Indian languages there are names for it that should be 
      carefully assembled by teams of linguists and then studied for their 
      meanings and associations. In Oaxaca, only among the Trique of Copala have 
      I found no familiarity with it.
      <P><A name=notas.23r>Past experience has shown that for a divinatory plant 
      to enlist the attention of the outside world two steps are usually 
      necessary. First, it should be correctly and securely identified. Second, 
      its chemistry should be convincingly worked out. Richard Evans Schultes 
      settled the identity of ololiuhqui in the definitive paper published in 
      1941. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.23"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A> 
      It is the seed of a species of Convolvulaccne: Rivea corymbosa (L.) Hall. 
      hi.
      <P>Schultes was not the first to link ololiuhqui with this family, but for 
      decades there had been disputes over its identity, and since Schultes 
      published his paper there has been none. The starting point for any 
      student of the subject is Schultes's paper.
      <P>It is not my intention here to tell over again the story told by 
      Schultes. I will only supplement what he had to say with this observation. 
      In the writers of the colonial period ololiuhqui receives frequent 
      mention, especially in the Tratado of Hernando Ruiz de Alarcon. Throughout 
      these references there runs a note of sombre poignancy as we see two 
      cultures in a duel to death--on the one hand, the fanaticism of sincere 
      Churchmen, hotly pursuing with the support of the harsh secular arm what 
      they considered a superstition and an idolatry; on the other, the tenacity 
      and wiles of the Indians defending their cherished ololiuhqui The Indians 
      appear to have won out.
      <P>Today in almost all the villages of Oaxaca one finds the seeds still 
      serving the natives as an ever present help in time of trouble.

      <P>Since the appearance of the Schultes paper in 1941, and apart from the 
      chemical findings of Dr. Hofmann, there has been only one important 
      contribution to our knowledge of the morning glory seeds. In 1960 Don 
      Totnis MacDougall published his discovery that in various parts of Oaxaca, 
      especially in the Zapotec area, another seed is used exactly as ololiuhqui 
      is. <A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.24"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> 
      This is the seed of a second morning glory, Ipomoea violacea L. In Zapotec 
      ololiuhqui is known currently as badoh; the second seed is badoh negro or 
      badungas, the full Zapotec equivalent of badoh negro. The black seeds are 
      long and somewhat angular. In Nahuatl they could hardly be called 
      ololuihqui, since this terms means the 'round things' or 'pellets'.
      <P><A name=notas.25r>The Nahua must have known them: what then did they 
      call them? We believe the answer is to be found in Pedro Pence's (sic) 
      <B>Breve Relacion de los Dioses y Rites de la Gentilidad</B>, Par. 46, 
      where he speaks of ololiuhqui, peyote, and tlitliltzin, all with the same 
      magic properties. The third, possibly a hapax in the corpus of surviving 
      classic Nahuatl documentation, is clearly not ololiuhqui, since both are 
      mentioned in the same sentence as distinct products. The word comes from 
      the Nahuatl root meaning 'black', with a reverential suffix. May we not 
      assume that this was the name current in classic Nahuatl for the black 
      seeds that Don Tomas found in wide use among the Zapotecs in the 1950's? 
      Apparently there is a further reference to badoh negro in the records of 
      the Inquisition: a Negro slave who was also a curandero used the term 
      ololiuhqui del moreno, which Dr. Aguirre Beltran thinks was his way of 
      saying 'black ololiuhqui'. But since this Negro was obviously a stranger 
      both to Nahuatl and to Spanish, little can be deduced from his 
      terminology.<A

      <UL><B>Note by R. E. Schultes:</B> <BR><I>*Taxonomically, the genus 
        Ipomoea is extremely difficult. The binomial Ipomoea tricolor has 
        already crept into the limited literature that has grown up in 
        connection with this second kind of ololiuqui. Inasmuch as some 
        confusion may result in the use of two names--ipomoea tricolor and I. 
        violacea- we should point out that, after a study of plant material and 
        the taxonomic history of these binomials, I am in agreement with the 
        American specialist in the Convolvulaceae, H. D. House (House, H. D.: 
        The North American species of the genus Ipomoea in Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 
        18 C19083 259), that both names actually refer to one polymorphic 
        species. In this case, then, the older name is Ipomoea Violacea L. Sp. 
        P1. (1753) 161, which should be used in preference to its synonym I. 
        tricolor Cav. Ic. P1. Rar. 3 (1794) 5, t. 208.
        <P></I></P></UL>
      <P>According to Don Tomas, in San Bartolo Yautepec, a village of the 
      Sierra Costera, only the black seed is used, but in many villages both 
      kinds are known. The black is widely regarded as the more potent. In some 
      places the black seed is called macho,'male', and the men take it; the 
      Rivea seed, known as hembra, 'female', is for the women. The dose is often 
      seven or a multiple thereof-- seven, or 14, or 21; or the seeds are 
      measured in the cup of the hand; or, as one informant in the Sierra 
      Mazateca told me, one takes a beer-cap full of Rivea seed.

      <P>These negative results may be explained by inadequate preparation. The 
      Indians grind the seeds on the metate (grinding stone) until they are 
      reduced to flour. Then the flour is soaked in cold water, and after a 
      short time the liquor is passed through a cloth strainer and drunk.
      <P>If taken whole, the seeds give no result, or even if they are cracked. 
      They must be ground to flour and then the flour soaked briefly in water. 
      Perhaps those who took the seeds without results did not grind them, or 
      did not grind them fine enough, and did not soak the resulting flour.
      <P>The chemistry of the seeds seems not to vary from region to region, and 
      seeds grown in the Antilles and in Europe are as potent as those grown in 
      Oaxaca. I have taken the black seeds twice in my home in New York, and 
      their potency is undeniable. 
      <P>Don Tomis MacDougall and his colleague Francisco Ortega of Tehuantepec, 
      both old and excellent friends of Ing. Weitlaner, have given us permission 
      to use their notes and photographs for this article.

    <TD>The black seeds are called variously in the Zapotec country: badoh 
      negro seems to be the prevalent name. But in the Zapotec dialect spoken in 
      San Bartolo Yautepec they are called la'aja shnash, 'seed of the Virgin'. 
      In this town Francisco Jiminez ('Chico Bartolo') took a series of 
      photographs in the course of a routine vigil.
      <P>A relative of his, Paula Jimenez, is a curandera, and she officiated, 
      and also dictated an account of the steps taken in the rite. We give a 
      paraphrase of what she said. 
      <P>
      <UL><I>First, the person who is to take the seeds must solemnly commit 
        himself to take them, and to go out and cut the branches with the seed. 
        There must also be a vow to the Virgin in favor of the sick person, so 
        that the seed will take effect with him. If there is no such vow, there 
        will be no effect. The sick person must seek out a child of seven or 
        eight years, a little girl if the patient is a man, a little boy if the 
        patient is a woman. The child should be freshly bathed and in clean 
        clothes, all fresh and clean. The seed is then measured out, the amount 
        that fills the cup of the hand, or about a thimbleful. The time should 
        be Friday, but at night, about eight or nine o'clock, and there must be 
        no noise, no noise at all. 
        <P>As for grinding the seed, in the beginning you say,'In the name of 
        God and of the Virgencita, be gracious and grant the remedy, and tell 
        us, Virgencita, what is wrong with the patient. Our hopes are in thee.'
        <P>To strain the ground seed, you should use a clean cloth--a new cloth, 
        if possible. When giving the drink to the patient, you must say three 
        Pater Nesters and three Ave Marias. A child must carry the bowl in his 
        hands, along with a censer. After having drunk the liquor, the patient 
        lies down. The bowl with the censer is placed underneath, at the head of 
        the bed. The child must remain with the other person, waiting to take 
        care of the patient and to hear what he will say. If there is 
        improvement, then the patient does not get up; he remains in bed. If 
        there is no improvement, the patient gets up and lies down again in 
        front of the altar. He stays there a while, and then rises and goes to 
        bed again, and he should not talk until the next day.
        <P>And so everything is revealed. You are told whether the trouble is an 
        act of malice or whether it is illness.</I></P></UL>
      <P>The photographs illustrate the curandera's account of a ceremony 
      invoking the divine power of the morning glory seeds. A feature of this 
      recital is the child who serves the beverage. He (or she) is ritually 
      cleansed, a symbol of purity. I encountered this practice for the first 
      time in 1960, in the Mixteca, in the Valley of Juxtlahuaca, when Robert 
      Ravicz and I were looking for survivals of the mushroom cult.
      <P><A name=notas.28r>The mushrooms were to be gathered by a virgin, they 
      were ground on the metate by a virgin.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.28"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A> 
      In 1968, in Ayautla and also in San Jose Tenango, in the Sierra Mazateca, 
      again a maiden ground the leaves of the Salvia divinorum. Here then is a 
      general pattern, whether in the Sierra Mazateca, or among the Mixtecs of 
      the Valley of Juxtlahuaca, or among the Zapotecs of San Bartolo Yautepec, 
      for the preparation of the divinatory agent, either the seeds of the 
      morning glory or the mushrooms or the <I>hojas de la Pastora</I>. 
      <P>(Had we been warned in advance to look for this, perhaps we should have 
      discovered the same custom in other regions visited in years previous to 
      1960.) Suddenly it dawns on us that a deep-seated harmony exists between 
      the role of the child in preparing the divine agent and the names 
      circulating throughout the Nahuatl area for the sacred mushrooms 
      themselves: we have found them called los ninos, 'the children', and las 
      hombrecitos y las mujercitas,'the little men and the little women', and 
      los senoritos, 'the lordlings'. Marina Rosas, curandera of San Pedro 
      Nexapa, on the slopes of Popocatepetl, called the sacred mushrooms in 
      Nahuatl apipiltzin, 'the noble princes of the waters', a singularly 
      appropriate name, in which the prefix 'a' conveys the sense of 'water'.
      <P>And here we revert to the miraculous plant that we think is the Salvia 
      divinorum, called (as we believe) in Nahuatl pipiltzintzintli, in the 
      records of the Inquisition dating from 1700. This is obviously related to 
      the name for the sacred mushrooms used by Marina Rosas. Dr. Aguirre 
      Beltran translates it as 'the most noble Prince' and relates it to 
      Piltzintli, the young god of the tender corn. In the accounts of the 
      visions that the Indians see after they consume the sacred food--whether 
      seeds or mushrooms or plant-- there frequently figure hombrecitos, 'little 
      men', mujercitas, 'little women', duendes, 'supernatural dwarfs'.
      <P>Beginning with our maiden at her metate, here is a fascinating complex 
      of associations that calls for further study and elaboration. For example, 
      are these Noble Children related perchance to the Holy Child of Atocha, 
      which gained an astonishing place in the hearts of the Indians of Middle 
      America? Did they seize on this Catholic image and make it a charismatic 
      icon because it expressed for them, in the new Christian religion, a theme 
      that was already familiar to them in their own supernatural beliefs?
      <P><A name=notas.29r>The tradition of the doncella at the metate is of 
      venerable age. Jacinto de la Serna, writing his <I>Manual para 
      Ministros</I> toward the middle of the 17th Century, said in his Chapter 
      XV:3 about ololiuhqui and peyotl:

      <P>What an extraordinary recapitulation of the salient features of the 
      divinatory ritual as practiced in Middle America! There is the 
      interweaving of Christian elements and pagan. There is the maiden grinding 
      the divine element, and the preparation of the suppliant, confessing and 
      communicating before he consults the Mediator. There is the sheltered 
      spot--protected from sound and light. There is the consultation on an 
      empty stomach. There is the clear intimation as to what one sees: a little 
      old man clothed in white and little boys garbed in the same. Finally there 
      is the august pronouncement whether the affliction of the suppliant can or 
      cannot be remedied. All these features are always present, regardless of 
      the divinatory plant that is consulted.
      <P><A name=notas.30r>Perhaps there is testimony far older than the 
      colonial records of the Inquisition. In the collection of Hans Namuth of 
      New York is a 'mushroom stone' of extraordinary features.<A 
      href="http://pages.prodigy.com/GBonline/liquix.htm#notas.30"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> 
      The cap of the mushroom carries the grooved ring that, according to 
      Stephan F. de Borhegyi, is the hallmark of the early pre-Classic period, 
      perhaps 3000 B.C. The stone comes from the Highlands of Guatemala. Out of 
      the stipe there leans forward a strong, eager, sensitive face, bending 
      over an inclined plane. It was not uhtil we had seen the doncella leaning 
      over a metate and grinding the sacred mushrooms in Juxtla- huaca in 1960, 
      that the explanation of the Namuth artifact came to us. The inclined plane 
      in front of the leaning human figure must be a metate. It follows that the 
      face must be that of a woman. Dr. Borhegyi and I went to see the artifact 
      once more: it was a woman!
      <P>A young woman, for her breasts were only budding, a doncella. How 
      exciting it is to make such a discovery as this: a theme that we find in 
      the contemporary Mixteca, and in the Sierra Mazateca, and in the Zapotec 
      country, is precisely the same as we find recorded in Jacinto de la Serna 
      and in the records of the Santo Oficio. Again it is precisely the same (if 
      our interpretation of the silent witness in the New York studio of Mr. 
      Namuth be correct) as in a stone carving that dates back perhaps 2500 
      years !

  <P>Chico's visit to the Chatino country served a dual purpose. In Beyond 
  Telepathy (Doubleday, N.Y., 1962) Andrija Puharich on page 20 had written, 
  'The author was also informed by certain brujos among the Chatino Indians 
  (living in Southern Oaxaca) that they used the Amanita muscaria for 
  hallucinogenic purposes. The proper dose is one-half of a mushroom.'
  <P>If true, this would be sensational. It is not true. A. muscaria is the 
  hallucinogenic mushroom of the Siberian tribesmen in their rites. It is not 
  used in Mexico.
  <P>When we first began visiting the Indian country of southern Mexico, we were 
  expecting to find that the hallucinogenic mushroom there was A. muscaria. For 
  ten years we combed the various regions and we have invariably found that it 
  played no role in the life of the Indians, though of course it is of common 
  occurrence in the woods. We had visited the Chatino country, where we were 
  accompanied by Bill Upson of the Institute Linguistico de Verano, who speaks 
  Chati. Later he likewise helped Puharich, but he informs us that no brujo in 
  his presence testified to the use of a mushroom answering to the description 
  of A. muscaria. 
  <P>After the Puharich statement had appeared, I gave Bill a photograph in 
  color of A. muscaria, and he returned to Juquila and Yaitepec. An informant 
  named Benigno recognized the mushroom at once and identified the stage of 
  development that it had reached, as would be expected of a countryman 
  intimately familiar with his environment. He said the people in his area do 
  not take that kind of mushroom.
  <P>Chico Ortega is a Zapotec Indian of mature years, keen intelligence, high 
  sense of responsibility, and vast experience throughout the villages of the 
  State of Oaxaca. 
  <P>In the summer of 1962 I sent him, with the color photo, to sound out 
  Chatino villagers as to the use they made of it. Discreetly, he went from 
  village to village.
  <P>The results were uniformly and unanimously negative.
  <P>Puharich in <B>The Magic Mushroom</B> as well as in his most recent book is 
  unduly impressed with the occurrence of A. muscaria. Wherever the species of 
  trees occur with which it lives in mycorrhizal relationship, it is common. It 
  is one of the commonest of fungi in North America and Eurasia. Puharich quotes 
  at length as an authority Victor Reko, a notorious forceur, not to be confused 
  with his cousin, Blas Pablo Reko.
  <P>Puharich does not identify the spot where he met his <I>(sic&gt;</I> 
  bl7ljo.r, though it seems probable that he did not get beyond the mestizo town 
  of Juquila. He does not explain how he put his question to them, how he 
  explained over a double linguistic barrier what A. Muscaria looked like. He 
  does not explain what precautions he took to avoid a leading question that 
  would almost certainly produce his desired answer. <A

<HR width="33%">

<UL><FONT size=+1><B>Note by R. E. Schultes:
  <P></B></FONT><I>Although the spelling ololiuqui has gained wide acceptance 
  and is now the commonest orthography, linguistic evidence indicates that this 
  Nahuatl word is correctly written ololiuhqui.
  <P>*There have recently been suggestions that the correct name of ololiuhqui 
  is Turbina corymbosa (L.) Raf.
  <P>These suggestions arise from two articles which have appeared in the past 
  several years: Roberty, G.- Genera Convolvulacearum in Candollea 14 (1952) 
  11-60; Wilson, K. A.- The genera of Convolvulaceae in the southeastern United 
  States in Journ. Am. Arb. 41 (1960) 298-317.
  <P>Roberty separates Ipomoea, Rivea and Turbina, putting the three into 
  different subfamilies. He keeps in Rivea only one species of India and Ceylon. 
  In Turbina, he has three species: T. corymbosa (which he states occurs in 
  tropical America, the Canary Islands and the Philippines) and two other 
  species of Mexico.
  <P>Wilson, in a key to the genera of Convolvulaceae in the southeastern 
  states, separates out Turbina as a genus distinct from Ipomoea. While Turbina 
  is keyed out as a distinct genus, there is no technical consideration of it in 
  the body of the paper which follows the key. One must assume, consequently, 
  that Turbina (as conceived by Wilson) does not occur in southeastern United 
  States. There is, furthermore, no reference to the binomial Turbina corymbosa 
  as such. Wilson pointed out that: Generic lines are difficult to draw in this 
  family, and treatments vary with different authors depending upon the emphasis 
  placed on the taxonomic characters used ... 
  <P>The question of whether to use the binomial Rivea corymbosa, or to assign 
  the concept to Ipomoea on the one hand or Turbina on the other is, in effect, 
  one of personal evaluation, by botanists, of the importance of characters.
  <P>When I first discussed ololiuhqui in 1941 (Schultes, R. E.: A contribution 
  to our knowledge of Rivea corymbosa, the narcotic ololiuqui of the Aztecs ), I 
  looked into the problem of the generic position of the concept. I decided 
  that, if indeed one were justified in separating this concept from Ipomoea, it 
  must be accommodated in Rivea. The outstanding Argentine specialist on the 
  Convolvulaceae, the late Dr. Carlos O'Donell, who was spending a year at 
  Harvard University at that time, worked with me closely in this study and was 
  in complete agreement. I have studied this problem again in connection with 
  Wasson's recent work and see no reason to change my opinion. Furthermore, it 
  is clear that such an authority as the late Professor E. D. Merrill referred 
  this concept to Rivea, placing Turbina in synonymy under Rivea and T. 
  corymbosa in synonymy under R. corymbosa.
  <P>In view of the fact that such authorities as O'Donell and Merrill elected 
  to use Rivea corymbosa; that Wilson acknowledges that the entire family is in 
  need of intensive study and ...all characters must be thoroughly re-evaluated 
  ; that Roberty's article is hardly conservative and actually adds little to 
  our basic knowledge of the family; and that the ethnobotanical and chemical 
  literature has accepted Rivea corymbosa--in view of all these circumstances 
  perhaps we might well continue to use the best known name until a really 
  comprehensive study by a recognized specialist indicates that it is wrong.
